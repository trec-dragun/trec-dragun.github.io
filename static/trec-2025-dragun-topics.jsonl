Public Domain\nIn This Story\nDestination Guide\nCanada\nPizza has been a core food for North Americans for so long that we forget that it is, relatively speaking, a new dish on our shores. Most people over the age of about 75 can remember the first time they ever saw, heard of, or tasted pizza; the New York Times first introduced the dish to its readers back in 1944.\nBut Sam Panopoulos*, 81, of London, Canada, a small city about halfway between Detroit and Toronto, can take it one step further. He can remember inventing what\u2019s now one of the most popular pizzas in the world: the Hawaiian pizza.\nThe Hawaiian pizza doesn\u2019t come from anywhere near Hawai\u2019i. It comes from Ontario, and was concocted in 1962 in a restaurant serving typical mid-century food without any particular focus. Since its creation, it has become a divisive and fiercely debated entry in the pizza lexicon; a reader-created post on BuzzFeed even called it \u201cthe most insulting and offensive pizza in the world.\u201d\nMelding canned pineapple and small squares of ham atop a regular cheese pizza, the Hawaiian is a niche pizza. In North America, you would never buy it for an office party or to feed hungry friends at a bar, at least not without a thorough interrogation to find out each eater\u2019s stance on the pie. Pizza is a dish that is universally loved in the U.S. and Canada, but Hawaiian pizza is, very often, despised.\nSam Panopoulos left Greece on a boat bound for Canada in 1954. His first exposure to pizza was in Naples, where the boat briefly stopped. Naples reigns as the worldwide birthplace of pizza, but even there, it\u2019s a fairly recent creation. As the story goes, the cheese and tomato-laden version of the dish that we recognize today was first baked in 1889 to honor the Italian monarchs King Umberto and Princess Margherita, who were visiting the city. Enter the now-classic margherita pizza.\nRelated\nNot a Fan of Hawaiian Pizza, Processed Cheese, and California Rolls? Blame Canada\nFusion foods and innovations associated with the U.S. quietly have roots farther north.\nRead more\nFew pizzas have caused as much controversy as this one. 9george/shutterstock.com\nPanopoulos didn\u2019t know anything about pizza\u2019s history; he just knew that the pie he had during his brief foray into Naples was pretty tasty. When he got to Canada in 1954, he settled in the town of Chatham, an hour from the border with Michigan. Panopoulos, who speaks with a thick Greek accent after 60 years in Ontario, achieved success early on, opening a restaurant called the Satellite in Chatham, which still stands (it\u2019s now under different management).\n\u201cPizza wasn\u2019t known at all, actually,\u201d says Panopoulos in a phone interview. \u201cEven Toronto didn\u2019t know anything about pizza in those days. The only place you could have pizza was in Detroit.\u201d\nSoon, pizza landed in Windsor, a Canadian city just across the river from Detroit. However, thanks to the execution, it wasn\u2019t especially popular there. \u201cI visited Windsor, and the pizza in those days was three things: dough, sauce, cheese, and mushroom, bacon, or pepperoni. That was it,\u201d says Panopoulos. \u201cYou had no choices; you could get one of the three [toppings] or more of them together.\u201d\nThe mushrooms were canned, the dough was pre-made and bought in bulk. The ovens were small electric ovens, certainly not suitable by modern standards. A standard pizza oven today cooks at around 800\u00b0 Fahrenheit to achieve the charred crust we associate with good pizza. Panopoulos\u2019 oven, and the ovens of the other pizza sellers in Detroit and Ontario, were nothing more than a standard apartment oven.\n\u201cThe pizza in Canada in those days was primitive, you know? In the States and Detroit and all this, it wasn\u2019t bad, but it was nothing special,\u201d says Panopoulos.\nPanopoulos\u2019s diner cooked the sort of food that people ate in the 1960s: pancakes in the morning, burgers and fries for lunch, and liver and onions for dinner. But he was eager to try out any new dishes that might entice customers. At one point, he hired, he says, an Asian cook and put him to work making American Chinese food. Later came pizza.\nAfter watching how pizza cooks in Windsor were making their pies, he came home to Chatham and started experimenting. The concept of pizza was totally foreign to his customers, and even to the general public. A 1962 recipe from the Toronto Star included a recipe for \u201cSpanish pizza,\u201d a strange concoction of yellow rice and Vienna sausages, piled on a dough made from biscuit mix.\nThere weren\u2019t even pizza boxes for quite a few years. Panopoulos said that he used to cut circles out of cardboard boxes he got from a furniture seller next door, place the pizza on top, and wrap the whole thing in aluminum foil.\nWithout really knowing or caring much about any traditions regarding pizza, Panopoulos began throwing together combinations to see what worked. Some of his discoveries were simultaneously discovered by other like-minded pizza pioneers, like the addition of salty toppings like olives and anchovies. But the pineapple was something else entirely.\nHawai\u2019i had only become a state in 1959, and soldiers coming home from World War II brought back tales of an island paradise in the South Pacific. Tiki culture, epitomized by fruity cocktails like the mai tai, became hugely popular from the 1940s through the 1960s. Canada wasn\u2019t immune to the charms of Hawai\u2019i, either, and canned pineapple became a staple of every household, advertised by grocery stores relentlessly in newspapers throughout Ontario.\nPanopoulos changed pizza history when he picked up a can of pineapple in 1962. BW Folsom/shutterstock.com\n\u201cIn those days, the only sweet and sour thing you would get is Chinese pork, you know, with the sweet and sour sauce,\u201d says Panopoulos. \u201cOtherwise there was no mix.\u201d\nHe was already serving Chinese food at the Satellite, and felt that people would connect to sweet and savory flavors together. So one day in 1962, he took down a can of pineapple, drained it, and threw the pieces of fruit on a pizza.\n\u201cPeople said \u2018you are crazy to do this,\u2019\u201d Panopoulos remembers. But he liked it immediately, and starting advertising his crazy new pizza topping. Amazingly, it caught on. The classic union of ham and pineapple was an accident, a result of only having a few different toppings to work with.\nOriginally, Panopoulos did not market it as the now-set combination of tart pineapple and savory ham or salty bacon. But the inventor called his new creation the \u201cHawaiian pizza\u201d from the start, and it quickly solidified into the version we know today. He told me more than once that he wishes he\u2019d found a way to register or patent the pairing.\nI ask Panopoulos if he still orders it today. \u201cYeah, I do,\u201d he says. \u201cI still like it.\u201d\n*Panopoulos passed away on June 8, 2017.

The number one global consumer is China, and the United States is ranked sixth in instant noodle sales, with 4.1 billion units sold in 2017. However, studies showed that eating instant noodles is linked to heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure and possibly cancer.\nIn the US, instant noodles are often referred to as Ramen. However, real Japanese Ramen is not a fast food dish. It\u2019s a noodle soup which is Japan\u2019s cultural icon, so a lot of care is put into its preparation.\nWhen instant noodles were first invented, they were sold under the brand name \u2018Chikin Ramen\u2019. Soon, instant noodles became known as Ramen outside of Japan, even if they are technically not Ramen.\nAdvertisement\nThe Ingredients in Instant Noodles Could be Toxic and May Cause Cancer\nIf we look at the composition of instant noodles, it becomes clear where the danger comes from. They are high in fat, high in salt, high in calories, and they\u2019re processed.\nInstant noodles also contain tertiary-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ), which is a chemical preservative that comes from the petroleum industry.\nTBHQ in instant noodles could cause cancer\nTertiary-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ) is a preservative that can be found in instant noodles and has been a source of many health discussions.\nTBHQ is used to extend the shelf life of oily and fatty foods, so it can often be found in fast food. It\u2019s also used in varnishes, cosmetics and perfumes. TBHQ is highly toxic in bigger doses, but has been allowed in the food industry in small doses.\nA number of studies have shown that prolonged exposure to high doses of TBHQ may be carcinogenic. But the conclusion is inconclusive because some studies have shown that TBHQ could prevent cancer.\nSmall doses of TBHQ have been approved for consumption by the FDA.\nThe FDA has set the limit of up to 0.02% of the total oils in food to be TBHQ. If you consumed 1 gram of TBHQ, this would very likely cause an adverse reaction, and 5 grams could be lethal.\nNobody is really sure what the safe limit is, but it doesn\u2019t seem like a good idea to have TBHQ lingering in your gut.\nMSG in instant noodles could have possible toxic effects\nAnother potentially toxic substance that is found in instant noodles is monosodium glutamate or MSG. This is a chemical called excitotoxin that overexcites your nerve cells.\nAdvertisement\nThe Experimental and Clinical Sciences journal reported that \u201cMSG has been linked with obesity, metabolic disorders, Chinese Restaurant Syndrome, neurotoxic effects and detrimental effects on the reproductive organs\u201d The journal also adds that \u201cin conclusion we would like to state that although MSG has proven its value as an enhancer of flavour, different studies have hinted at possible toxic effects related to this popular food-additive\u201d.\nClearly, an odd package of instant noodles won\u2019t kill you, but no one can say with certainty what this processed food will do to you in the long run.\nRelated: 7 Cancer Causing Products to Remove From Your Home\nEating Instant Noodles Could Cause Stroke and Heart Attack\nIn June 2014, a comprehensive study was published in The Journal of Nutrition that revealed the dangers lurking inside your cup of noodles. According to the international group of scientists, instant noodles are associated with cardio-metabolic risks, which mainly refer to the risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It seems that the handy and delicious dish comes at a price.\nThe study was conducted in South Korea, which has the highest per-capita number of instant noodle consumers in the world. Also, in recent years, a higher proportion of Koreans started developing conditions such as heart disease and obesity, so it seemed worthwhile to explore the reasons behind this decline in health.\nAdvertisement\nA total of 10,711 adults (54.5% women) between the ages of 19 and 64 were included in the study. Their dietary patterns were analyzed by Hyoun Shin, a doctoral candidate at the Harvard School of Public Health, and his colleagues.\nTwo major dietary patterns were identified:\n\u201c traditional dietary pattern \u201d, rich in rice, fish, vegetables, fruit, and potatoes.\n\u201c meat and fast-food pattern \u201d, rich in meat, soda, fried food, and fast food including instant noodles.\nThe researchers observed that people who ate traditional food, were more unlikely to suffer from high blood pressure.\nFast food diet was associated with abdominal obesity, higher levels of LDL cholesterol (the \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol), and high triglycerides, which all increase the risk of heart disease and metabolic syndrome.\nEating instant noodles is linked to stroke, diabetes and heart conditions\nWhen Shin looked specifically at instant noodles, the analysis showed that women who ate more than two portions per week had a higher chance of developing metabolic syndrome, which is linked to heart conditions, stroke and diabetes.\nThe association was found even among young women who were slimmer and more physically active. The correlation was not observed in men.\nAdvertisement\nRelated: These Drinks \u201cIncrease Stroke Risk by 500%\u201d\nInstant Ramen Noodles Don\u2019t Break Down After Hours of Digestion\nIn another study, scientists put a little, pill-sized camera inside the stomach of a person who just ate instant Ramen noodles. This enabled them to follow the digestive process and observe what happens once the quick meal reaches the stomach.\nThe results were disheartening for all instant noodle lovers. It appears that the body has great difficulty breaking these noodles down.\nAfter two hours, the meal was still more or less intact, which is very unusual. For comparison, when the participant ate homemade noodles, these digested much quicker, so after two hours there was hardly anything left to see in the stomach.\nThis small study was conducted by Dr. Braden Kuo of Massachusetts General Hospital, and was the first experiment of its kind. Dr. Kuo points out that his experiment doesn\u2019t show instant noodles are necessarily harmful for you.\nThe sample was too small, and further research is needed to establish the effects the slow digestive process has on the gastro-intestinal tract and your body as a whole. Dr. Kuo even admits still eating instant Ramen noodles himself, but he does it in moderation.\nHere is a video showing what happens when you eat instant noodles\nYouTube\nSubscribe\nWatch later\nCopy link\nInfo\nShopping\nTap to unmute\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\nMore videos\nMore videos\nYou're signed out\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

By staying in the stomach for so long, the noodles put a strain on the digestive tract as it has to work continuously.\nAlso, instant Ramen contains a lot of different additives and preservatives, which remain in the digestive tract for so long. It\u2019s not sure what the long exposure does to the body, but it\u2019s probably not that beneficial to your health.\nRead this article: Scientists Warn Parents to Stop Feeding Children This Food Due to Cancer Risk\nRelated articles:\nTrisodium phosphate (TSP) in Cereal or In Food: Is it Really Safe?\nCooking with Aluminum Foil \u2013 Is it a Safe Option?\n7 Cancer Causing Products to Remove From Your Home\nInstant Noodles Are Linked to Stroke, Diabetes, Weight Gain, and Even Cancer According to Studies was last modified: February 8th, 2020 by Jenny Hills, Nutritionist and Medical Writer", "docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_06_1440134319"}

They are rich in many essential nutrients; they ease respiratory and digestive distress and are a natural stimulant and painkiller. Indigenous tradition and scientific studies have both confirmed that in their natural form, the leaves are completely safe and non-addictive -- it takes intensive processing and toxic chemical ingredients to produce cocaine. That's why more and more coca-containing products have started to hit the market in Andean countries in the past few years.\nYet the United States still aggressively pursues an eradication policy that encourages Andean governments to spray their forests with toxic chemicals to eliminate this medicinal crop. It is illegal to import or possess the leaves under U.S. law -- unless you're the Coca-Cola company. In an effort to preserve the traditional flavor of the best-selling drink, the company long ago convinced the U.S. government to exempt it from the law.\n(Coca-Cola, by the way, used to literally contain cocaine in its original formula. The practice was halted in 1903, but the name persisted. The \"coca\" part of \"coca-cola\" is derived from the coca plant, and the \"kola\" comes from the kola nut which also flavored the original beverage.)\nThe secret history of Coca-Cola, coca leaves and cocaine\nCoca-Cola is the only U.S. corporation that has been granted the right to legally import coca leaves into the United States, via a coca processing lab known as the Stepan Company ). In 1922, the Jones-Miller Act banned cocaine imports into the United States, but Coca-Cola (and its lab) was granted an exception. This exception remained a secret until the late 1980's when the New York Times seemed shocked to discover the truth.\nAs the New York Times published in 1988 ( http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/01/business/h...)\nThis week, details of how Coca-Cola obtains the coca and how it is processed emerged from interviews with Government officials and scientists involved in drug research programs. They identified the Illinois-based Stepan Company as the importer and processor of the coca used in Coke. After Stepan officials acknowledged their ties to Coca-Cola, the soft drink giant confirmed those details of its operations.\nIn a telephone interview from Coca-Cola's Atlanta headquarters, Randy Donaldson, a company spokesman, said, ''Ingredients from the coca leaf are used, but there is no cocaine in it and it is all tightly overseen by regulatory authorities.''\n100 tons of cocaine ingredients each year - let's do the math\nApproximately 100 metric tons of coca leaves are imported to the Stepan Company each year ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepan_Company) under \"special permission\" from the DEA. Keep all this in mind when you consider the total fraud of the current \"War on Drugs\" and how young African American men are given ten-year prison sentences for pot possession while one of the largest corporations in America is actually importing leaves that are used to manufacture cocaine.\nOnce the coca leaves are imported into the USA under these special permissions from the DEA, the cocaine is extracted out of the coca leaves. Coca-Cola doesn't use the cocaine, you see. There is no cocaine in Coca-Cola today.\nThis brings up an obvious question: Where does all the white powder cocaine go if not to Coca-Cola? It turns out that this cocaine is sold to a St. Louis company called Mallinckrodt Incorporated.\nMallinckrodt receives not only all the cocaine from the Coca-Cola imports, but also imports opium from India ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallinckrodt ). In addition, this company also buys THC extracted from marijuana grown in the United States. So much for the War on Drugs, huh? It turns out if you buddy up to the DEA and federal regulators, you can make all the cocaine you want while buying opium and marijuana by the ton -- as long as you're a powerful corporation with ties to Coca-Cola and other wealthy organizations.\nMore than a quarter ton of cocaine for \"medicinal\" use?\nIt's a reasonable question to wonder where all this cocaine and opium ends up going after it arrives at Mallinckrodt. The official explanation is that it's for \"medical use.\" But let's do the math on this and see if that explanation holds water.\nAccording to various websites that are readily found in any search engine, it takes roughly 300 grams of coca leaves to produce 1 gram of refined cocaine. This means that 100 metric tons of coca leaves (100 x 1000 kilograms, or 100,000 kilograms) can produce roughly 333 kilos of cocaine each year.\nAsk around... That's a lot of cocaine. Remember, too, that these are 333 kilos of cocaine approved by the DEA -- an agency which claims to be fighting a \"war on drugs\" but somehow grants immunity to Coca-Cola suppliers who are literally manufacturing hundreds of kilos of cocaine each year.\nAll this brings up the obvious question: What is the Mallinckrodt company doing with 333 kilos of cocaine each year? Throwing a big annual Christmas party or something? It is impossible to imagine that 333 kilos of cocaine are being used for \"medical purposes\" unless you have a very loose definition of \"medical purposes.\" Although this is pure conjecture, I wouldn't be surprised to learn if a significant portion of this was handed out to top DEA officials as bribes to pay them off and keep the cocaine operation running.\nEnough lines of cocaine for the entire U.S. Congress!\nContinuing with the math, 333 kilos is (obviously) 333,000 grams of cocaine. How much cocaine is that, exactly? Well, according to TheGoodDrugsGuide.com, a typical \"line\" of cocaine (a \"line\" is what a typical user will inhale to ingest the cocaine) contains 50 - 75mg, or roughly 1/20th of a gram ( http://www.thegooddrugsguide.com/cocaine/faq... ).\nThis means that each gram of cocaine is enough to make up to 20 \"lines\" of cocaine, give or take, depending on how crazy you and your friends are.\nMultiply that by the 333,000 grams of cocaine that could be produced from the 100 metric tons of cocaine leaves being imported into the USA each year, and you come to the astonishing realization that the coca leaves imported for the benefit of the Coca-Cola company can be processed into the equivalent of 6.66 million lines of cocaine each year!\nHere's the math again (calculations are all rounded for the sake of convenience, so they're just rough estimates):\n100 metric tons of coca leaves = 100,000 kilograms of coca leaves\n100,000 kilograms of coca leaves produces 333 kilograms of cocaine\n333 kilograms equals 333,000 grams\n333,000 grams of cocaine can be divided into 6.66 million \"lines\" of cocaine\nP.S. According to Wiki Answers, 333,000 grams of cocaine is worth roughly $16.7 million on the street (at $50 a gram).\nIt strains the limits of believability to think that 333,000 grams of cocaine are being used for \"medical purposes\" in America. How and where are 333,000 grams of cocaine being used for \"medical purposes?\" I mean, have you ever gone to your doctor and watched him write a prescription for cocaine? Nope.\nThis seemingly leaves only three possibilities for where all this cocaine is going:\nPossibility #1) The Mallinckrodt company might be stockpiling massive amounts of cocaine each year, perhaps dwarfing Disneyland's \"Space Mountain\" ride.\nPossibility #2) The Mallinckrodt company might be somehow destroying massive amounts of cocaine each year. (But human greed probably prevents this from happening, given that this white power is so darned valuable...)\nPossibility #3) The Mallinckrodt company might be \"losing track\" of massive amounts of cocaine each year (i.e. is disappears out the back door and into the hands of DEA agents and politicians who keep the whole operation \"legal\"). This is one case where brown-nosing the DEA leaves a thin layer of white dust on your nose, too.\nOr hey, maybe all this cocaine is being quietly distributed to all the doctors and pharmacists who are chronically addicted to drugs themselves -- it's a huge percentage of the medical workforce because they have access to drugs on a day-to-day basis and they think they need a pharmaceutical kick to survive their long work hours. 6.66 million lines of cocaine is enough to keep a few thousand pharmacists churning away, filling high-profit prescriptions for painkillers and psychiatric drugs that turn everybody else into addicts, too.\nLearn more amazing facts about food in our downloadable FREE report\nThis true story about Coca-Cola is just one of the amazing facts you'll read in our FREE downloadable report, 25 Amazing Facts About Food, authored by Mike Adams and David Guiterrez.\nLearn surprising things about where your food comes from and what's really in it!

The DEA has always had a policy to enforce the control of restricted substances. Cocane, along with other drugs, is a restricted substance. Notice I did not say illegal. It is illegal for Joe blow, selling drugs down the street, to give it to anyone with a c-note for recreational purposes.\nCoca-cola has a deal with the companies that subject themselves to tight scrutiny by the DEA in order to ensure compliance with federal law.\nThe article also suggests that people in the DEA are paid in cocaine to look the other way. This is rediculous. The policies of allowing imports of cocoa leaves is made at a level much higher then the DEA. The DEA only enforces drug compliance, it does not make policy.\nIf you really are so offended by coca-cola, which this article admits doesn't contain containe, then write your congressman.

But take some time to actually research topics. Cocaine is used, actually quite frequently, in nose surgeries as a local anesthetic. It is excellent for this purpose because it constricts the many small blood vessels in the nose, which decreases bleeding. Many ENT surgeons can do 5-10 cases a day. Each case using the cocaine and the rest of the vial cannot be used for the next patient and gets wasted. This happens 5 days a week in the operating room at a lot of hospitals and surgery centers around the country. So would it be realistic that this is actually being used for medical purposes. I would say 100% this could be the case.\nsee more\nShow more replies\n\u2212\n+\nDean \u2022 6 years ago\nPossibility #4: Mallinckrodt turns the cocaine into cocaine hydrochloride which is a topical anaesthetic used in some medical procedures of the ear, nose and throat.\nsee more\nShow more replies\n\u2212\n+\nUDEM \u2022 6 years ago \u2022 edited\nWell, well, well.

Something that should additionally be noted is that the fact that large corporations, government entities, etc. can indeed buy, process and sell controlled substances. However, there is a major difference between that of a normal everyday individual and that of these organizations, the use for these substances. Perhaps, there is corruption, there always is with any type of human structure but in large these corporations are not slinging kilos of cocaine on the corner of the street for junkies to get a recreational high off of. Nearly every plant that can be used for a recreational high has medicinal potential and purpose, the difference between some pot head allegedly using it for medicinal purposes and a pharmacy dispensing a tabular form of THC is precision, purity, and explicit purpose and dosage. Hey, but if you do not believe me, next time you break your leg instead of getting morphine from the doctor just go smoke a pipe of opium. Cocaine is used in a lot of pharmaceutical drugs for various medicinal purposes, I highly doubt the government is selling off extra coke on the side.

Is the coke \"medicinal\" (government-approved)?\nCoca-Cola: We regret to inform you that our recipe cards/cookbooks are\nno longer in print. However, you may wish to visit the Heritage section\nof our Company website. Here you will find a variety of delicious\nrecipes that utilize products of The Coca-Cola Company in the ingredients. All recipes are printable in our Heritage page.\n#2 What are the best recipes for a family beverage that contains cocaine? My entire family is addicted to Coke!\nCoca-Cola: Our brands are not addictive. The degree to which some\npeople consume soft drinks and other food products depends on their\nliking for them rather than a habit they need to satisfy. People\ncontinue to drink Coca-Cola simply because they enjoy the taste.\n#3 How does Coca-Cola get away with not listing the ingredients of its secret recipe? Doesn't the FDA ask you to?\nCoca-Cola: As you can imagine, our flavor formulations are our most\nvaluable trade secrets. Therefore, we do not discuss the flavor\ncomposition of any of our products.\n#4 If I created a new soft drink, the FDA would ask me to release the entire list of ingredients. Coke is exempt?\nCoca-Cola: For ingredient information on many of our U.S. brands, click\nhere (PDF). Or you can look up a specific ingredient at the Beverage\nInstitute for Health & Wellness.\n#5 Thank you. You've answered my questions in exactly the way an agent for a covert operation would.

Cocaine is not on the coca leaf, cocaine is a chemical produced from proccesing the coca leaf with sulfuric acid, gasoline, diesel, sodium, glue, cement, pothasium and other chemicals that make the coca leaf produce an alkaloid named Erythroxyline being a very dangerous drug. You cannot extract cocaine or the alkaloid out of the coca leaf since there isn't any in the coca leaf, it only appears after the chemical proccesing. That is why it is allowed to be imported to the USA with DEA approval, since coca leaf per se is not a drug.\nsee more\n\u2212\n+\ncliffr Patricia L\u00f3pez \u2022 6 years ago\ncoca leaf, and a few related species of erythroxylum have for the \"most part\"\n( meaning as a general wholesale analysis performed over years on various regional populations and related variant cultivars and batches of import/export materials collected into \"batch lots\" and NOT INDIVIDUAL LEAF SAMPLES)..... been empirically proven to contain cocaine amongst the other bioactive alkaloidal compounds verified via over a century of chemical analysis ...though levels fluctuate depending on genotype, regional/local environmental conditions, agricultural practices, and most likely unknown causative reasons.\nit is true that various alkaloidal components that occur in these leaves can be further processed into cocaine, as they are precursors to cocaine, or intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway of alkaloidal molecular construct known as metabolic or catabolic biosynthesis.\nso your statement above does carry some truth, but also some error. to further complicate the subject, variant forms of alkaloids are formed via the attachment of other elements or molecular groups to the alkaloid structure, this can enhance,or detract from the bioavailability and chemical reactivity of said compound, thus freebase cocaine and other freebase (alkaline) compounds can have pronounced activity, reactivity, and I guess in regards to each specific compound type, may also have reduced activity or reactivity.\nconsider that arecoline in betel nut can be used as a precursor to synthesize cocaine in the lab, and now with the advent of gene splicing to augment biosynthesis pathways in organisms, I expect that already or soon enough various plants, microbes and higher organisms could also be designed or even possibly via natural mutation come to produce compounds not formally possible under current conditions.\nas the DEA doesn't currently generally set a minimum parts per milligram per gram, kilo, ton, of illicit or controlled substances unless specifically addressed\nin a formulated compounded approved medication, the natural world and the created or augmented world of humans commodities invariably are beset with controlled substances in civic and natural water sheds, money, sewage systems, agricultural products, and even in natural standing populations of plants and animals.\nuntil the DEA sets standards for allowable amounts of controlled substances in objects/substances in the parts per trillion, billion, million, and milligrams per gram, a grey area of legality will continue to expand.\nconsider this,\nhumans and most animals produce ENDOGENOUS morphine...this is an empirical discovery. This happens mostly in the brain, unless you consider white blood cells are gene encoded to produce endogenous morphine when sepsis happens in the blood stream. that is why usually morphine doesn't show up in urine during drug testing unless the animal consumes morphine, or its precursors like L-Dopa, and I suspect will be found in the urine in patients that are suffering from sepsis.\nsome plants also produce morphine precursors like reticuline and salutaridine....these compounds occur in some plants in the USDA food supply, and in various parts of animal tissues such as brain.\nMorphine and codeine have also been detected in bovine and human mothers milk, and I suspect are not always a product of exogenous consumption, but probably will be found to be a product of endogenous production for good reason.\nTrue, coca leaf can be brought into the USA most times in small amounts as a personal carry-on item via ship, train, plane or automobile or foot traffic crossing borders. But that is more a matter of providence and \"good luck\" or knowing the right official or probably most times neglect of officials in knowing phytochemistry and botanical taxonomy and identification......getting an import license for technical commodity industrial and commercial importation is basically a monopoly of organized corporate special preference, and I suspect, also a benefit for corrupted military and corporate organizations, though those groups generally just import relatively pure cocaine and don't bother with bulky leaf importation.\nBy far the most likely, largest method of coca leaf importation into the USA outside of the licensed corporate benefactor is done by private courier corporations and I suspect most successfully via the USPS....as US customs is hard pressed to search even 10% of packages coming into the USA for drugs of illicit, to their credit the US customs officers are most successful in detecting ions for the detection of explosives....but that doesn't mean they open every package in every shipping container or plane or boat bringing international mail or commodity shipments.\nso cocaine does indeed occur in nature...its not solely a synthetic product produced in labs, it is however augmented, or synthesized, adulterated, catabolized, metabolized and.\ncocaine analogs have been created, many of them, and compounds that occur in nature have been used as precursors for such, as have synthetically created intermediates that do not occur naturally.\nconsider that arecoline in betel nut is not generally considered a controlled substance, except by the FDA as a food additive and dietary supplement, although that doesn't stop many asian markets selling the betel nut and its products in the USA, and until recently around the early 1900's, was considered the most prolifically consumed stimulant besides caffeine known to man until nicotine and tobacco consumption increased and in many cases tobacco was added as an ingredient to the betel nut quid.\npure arecoline is a somewhat common fine chemical, available for relatively cheap from thousands of chemical vendors and corporations, and in pure form, hardly controlled at all except by compounding for medications or veterinarian preparations.\nand definitely cocaine can be and is taken out of the coca leaf, as are many of the other alkaloids, this is a common practice for processing the plant material for some purposes, such as for use by the coca cola company, as they must protect their trademark rights on their name by including a scant minuscule amount of coca leaf extract in their product or they will lose the trademark protection.....the word coca and cola/kola are common words, not proprietarily owned by that corporation per se, its the trademark and recipe and artistic control they are after....not retaining the original recipe.\nthe point of detection via analysis at some point doesn't detect minuscule amounts, just as hemp and hemp protein and oils at some point of processing are not detectable to contain THC, and thus in the USA have been vigorously fought for legality as commodities in courts by corporate lawyers well funded by corporations and some individuals afforded by the boon of income generated in regards to the study and exercise of human and corporate rights as applies to economic botany provided by the consumption of natural products by billions of human beings.\nI don't think analytical equipment is generally used, or maybe even exists that can detect molecules in matrixes or solutions in the parts per trillions....consider that cocaine adulterates water supplies, physical objects, an currency around the world, because it is a natural and synthetically produced commodity consumed by millions of people, maybe even billions, in some cases, legally, and would be found to be a material that would invariably be a cross contaminating substance in analysis of the very, very minute scale.\nsee more\nShow more replies\nShow more replies\n\u2212\n+\nBread Sandwich \u2022 7 years ago \u2022 edited\nYou can't just \"take the cocaine out of the coca leaf\" and then use whatever is left in the leaf in order to obtain anything of value: mild stimulant properties and/or anesthetic properties, or even coca leaf flavoring, if Coca Cola only wanted that. Those 3 things are the only things Coca Cola would be interested in for its drink - unless they are interested in whatever else is left out of a coca leaf after making cocaine out of it, which is likely only kerosene-laden fibrous plant cellulose. So unless Coca Cola is using discarded chemically polluted coca leaves to flavor their drink, or they have innovated some new way to take cocaine out of the leaf and render it \"drug-less\" while still maintaining something left of the leaf that can still be legally put into the drink - I don't think the company or anyone else is using those leaves for cocaine. The only other viable probability is that there isn't actually coca in the drink at all and they are just outright selling the leaves to make cocaine instead.

It was, for many years, a legal, lawful product in America.\n2. People who want it, get it. Right now. The war on drugs is a failure.\n3. Yes, it will f--k some people up, but is that\na good reason to ban it? A small but significant fraction of folks cannot handle\nalcohol, but that's still legal.\n4. Most people that I know use cocaine responsibly.\n5. It is only self-destructive, self-hating people who end up dying from their addictions, and this group is always quite small percentage of the population.\n6. Only people who are self-destructive and self-hating will ever become addicted in the first place. These folks are hellbent on self-destruction, and they will do it, whether it's through illegal drugs or not.\nNo, I'm not a shrink, but I know a PhD in psychology from Columbia who has had 50 years working with these people, and his\nstories are in line with my experience.\nThere are ways to decriminalize cocaine\nwhile, at the same time, passing laws to stop food manufacturers from adding it to their products to get us addicted, as they do with caffeine, msg, just the right combo of fat, salt, and sugar, etc.\nBottom line: It's my life, and if I want cocaine, I shall purchase same, be it lawful or extralegal.\nsee more\nShow more replies\n\u2212\n+\nKarstein Stuverud \u2022 7 years ago \u2022 edited\nCoca leaf is the Real Thing.Without it,Coca cola would taste like coffee with alotof sugar.\nThe secret to coca colas famous taste is: Coca leaf & its wonderful bouquet.\nsee more\n\u2212\n+\nPatricia L\u00f3pez Karstein Stuverud \u2022 7 years ago\nI have tasted coca leaf and it doesn't taste like Coca Cola at all.

And that day could come sooner than anticipated.\nBy Robert Stevens\n6 min read May 12, 2020\nMay 12, 2020\nIn brief\nA 4,000 qubit quantum computer could, theoretically, crack Bitcoin's encryption in a matter of seconds.\nThe current generation of quantum computers max out at 54 qubits.\nA quantum computer capable of cracking Bitcoin's encryption could be just two years away.\nIf you had a powerful enough computer, you could, theoretically, take control of the Bitcoin blockchain. You could credit your account with free Bitcoin or prevent others from making transactions. Since the private key to each wallet can be derived from a public key, you could access the Bitcoin wallet of whomever you wished. The keys to the $163 billion castle would be yours\u2014of course, in that scenario, Bitcoin\u2019s price would surely plummet as soon as its claims of invulnerability were found to be baseless.\nWhereas even the most powerful supercomputer would take thousands of years to crack Bitcoin, there are machines that could, theoretically, do so in a matter of seconds. These ultra-fast devices are called quantum computers.\nAnd they\u2019re real\u2014currently in development by some of the finest minds on the planet.\nBitcoin\u2019s race to outrun the quantum computer\nWant to steal some Bitcoin? All you need to do is find your victim\u2019s 16-character public key and calculate their private key by solving something called an \u201celliptic curve discrete logarithm p...\nNews Coins\nRobert Stevens Aug 18, 2019\nAug 18, 2019\n7 min read\n7 min read\nSome experts told Decrypt that it\u2019s already too late for Bitcoin; quantum computers, developed in secrecy by governments, could corrupt the blockchain in just a few years' time.\nBut others, including some developers of quantum computers, say that the anxiety is farfetched and distant; by the time quantum computers become reliable and powerful enough to attack Bitcoin, blockchain developers will have already patched this vulnerability.\nWant to know more? This comprehensive guide contains everything you need to know about quantum computers and Bitcoin.\nWhat are quantum computers?\nQuantum physics involves the investigation of structures smaller than atoms. When looking at sub-atomic structures, the laws of physics go out the window and crazy things begin to happen. Quantum computers exploit those properties to perform calculations far faster than even the most powerful supercomputer.\nTraditional computers, like the one you\u2019re reading this article on, operate in terms of 1s and 0s. If something is \u201ctrue\u201d, then the transistor will register a 1. And if it\u2019s \u201cfalse,\u201d the transistor will read 0. There are billions of transistors in each computer; an estimated 13 sectillion have been created since the first one was created in 1947, making it the most manufactured device, period.\nBut due to something called \u201cquantum superposition\u201d, the transistors in quantum computers can register both 1 and 0 simultaneously, meaning that a quantum transistor is exponentially more powerful than a regular computer.\nHow could quantum computers crack Bitcoin\u2019s code?\nBitcoin uses something called the Elliptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to sign digital signatures, and uses a cryptography standard called SHA-256 to hash blocks on the chain.\nWith Bitcoin, a private key, picked at random, is run through these algorithms to generate a public key. And the Bitcoin protocol uses the hash value of this to create a public Bitcoin address.\nGoogle's quantum computer (Image: Google)\nA quantum computer could reverse this process and derive the private key from a public one. And voila! Bitcoin\u2019s claim of inviolability and unhackability is gone, and you have access to any Bitcoin wallet you want.\nTwo major quantum algorithms that threaten the current state of cryptography have already been developed: Grover's and Shor's algorithms.\n\u201cAn adversary could insert its own blocks and undermine the entire blockchain.\u201d\nRob Campbell\nRob Campbell, President at Baltimore, Maryland-based Med Cybersecurity, told Decrypt that quantum computers using both Grover\u2019s and Shor\u2019s algorithm could also \u201cmine much faster than everyone else, and therefore an adversary could insert its own blocks and undermine the entire blockchain.\u201d\nWhen will quantum computers pose a threat to Bitcoin?\nYouTube\nGoogle\n10M subscribers\nSubscribe\nDemonstrating Quantum Supremacy\nInfo\nShopping\nTap to unmute\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\nYou're signed out\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

The thing is, the most powerful quantum computers today are\u2026 decidedly less powerful. In October 2019, Google announced a quantum computer with 54 qubits; it\u2019s the most powerful quantum computer announced in the public domain.\nBut Campbell said that major companies, such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM are making \u201crapid progress,\u201d as are a host of smaller companies.\nSo how long until the quantum computing threat becomes a problem for Bitcoin? It depends whom you ask. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, was among the first major figures to put a deadline on it. He said: \"In a five to 10 year time frame, quantum computing will break encryption as we know it today.\"\nSome blockchain leaders are not worried by this timeline. At Web Summit 2019, Hedera Hashgraph founder Dr. Leemon Baird compared the quantum computing threat to the Y2K problem\u2014a date formatting issue that doomsdayers thought would break the world\u2019s major computer systems come January 1, 2000. Said Baird: \u201cLike Y2K; yes, we had to make some changes to software at Y2K. Was it the end of the world? Actually, no.\u201d\nWhat Google\u2019s quantum computer means for Bitcoin\nA document published\u2014and later deleted\u2014by NASA a few days ago revealed that we could soon be entering a new technological era: Google has achieved \"quantum supremacy\"\u2014supposedly. According to ...\nNews Technology\nJose Antonio Lanz Sep 25, 2019\nSep 28, 2019\n4 min read\n4 min read\nVitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, is also unfazed. He told Forkast News in October 2019 that, \u201cFor every cryptographic algorithm that quantum computers can break, we know that we have a replacement [\u2026] that quantum computers cannot break.\" Though these may be less efficient, \"We have an upgrade path and we know what the upgrade path is,\u201d he said.\nBut the threat could be far more imminent, Andersen Cheng, CEO of London-based cryptography company Post-Quantum, told Decrypt. In the intelligence world, which Cheng knows well\u2014his company has worked with the counter-terrorism departments of organizations such as NATO, GCHQ, and NCSC\u2014\u201cthere's been some evidence that it could well be around two years away.\u201d\nThe Sycamore processor at the heart of Google's quantum computer (Image: Google)\nCheng said that Pichai\u2019s prediction of five to ten years is based on commercially available quantum computers; no government is going to let on that they have a huge quantum computer \u201cthe size of a stadium\u201d hidden away in an underground bunker, he said.\nFor Pichai to sell Google's quantum computer to other companies, it would have to be stable and practical. But for a government computer, none of this matters \u201cso long as you can start cracking encryption,\u201d said Cheng.\nCheng also dismissed concerns that a quantum computer would have to be purpose-built to crack Bitcoin\u2019s code, and whether that could take even longer. Since Shor and Grover's algorithms already exist, \u201cpeople know exactly what to do, but they just haven't got the power to do it.\u201d Now, people are \u201cjust waiting for the power to arise.\u201d\nAre quantum-secure blockchains possible?\nRight now, it\u2019s up to the blockchain and cryptography community to build quantum-secure blockchains.\nOne major milestone is a competition to create post-quantum cryptographic algorithms run by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), the cryptography world\u2019s standard setter. NIST\u2019s winner would determine the algorithm for a blockchain that\u2019s resilient to quantum computers.\nI am extremely pleased to finally be able to bring a new, exciting project out of stealth: @praxxis_io https://t.co/CMcVZLtSxe\n\u2014 David Chaum (@chaumdotcom) August 20, 2019\nThen, blockchains could fork to a post-quantum-secure algorithm. Or, blockchains could start from the ground up. For instance, David Chaum, creator of digital cash, has begun work on Praxxis, a \u201cquantum-resistant\u201d blockchain that claims to use quantum-resistant digital signatures to sign transactions for the platform\u2019s native currency, the xx coin.\nBut it\u2019s too early to call things until NIST makes its judgment, which Cheng predicts would be as late as 2022.\nUntil then, Bitcoin holders will be living in a state of quantum uncertainty.\nhttps://decrypt.co/28560/quantum-computers-could-crack-bitcoins-encryption-by-2022\nRead on the Decrypt App for the best experience.\nFor the best experience, top crypto news at your fingertips and exclusive features download now.", "docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_15_116067546"}

The company is partnering with Lil Nas X to offer 666 pairs of the limited-edition shoes for one day only. The limited-edition shoes are redesigned Nike shoes, and Nike has since filed a lawsuit against MSCHF over trademark infringement.\nA product website for the shoes has announced that the shoes would go on sale on March 29 on MSCHF\u2019s official app. They quickly sold out of all 666 pairs.\nThe Shoes Are Promoted as Each Including One Drop of Actual Human Blood\nMSCHF x Lil Nas X \"Satan Shoes\" \ud83c\udff9\n\ud83d\udc5fNike Air Max '97\n\ud83e\ude78Contains 60cc ink and 1 drop of human blood\n\ud83d\udde1\ufe0f666 Pairs, individually numbered\n\ud83d\udcb0$1,018\n\ud83d\uddd3\ufe0fMarch 29th, 2021 pic.twitter.com/XUMA9TKGSX\n\u2014 SAINT (@saint) March 26, 2021\nThe shoes were announced as a collaboration between MSCHF and Lil Nas X to create a limited-edition version of the Nike Air Max 97. According to the product\u2019s website, the shoes are individually numbered and only 666 pairs will be sold. These shoes aren\u2019t created by Nike. They\u2019re revamped Air Max 97s by MSCHF made in collaboration with Lil Nas X, Page Six reported. The shoes cost more than $1,000 a pair.\nA Nike spokesperson explained to Snopes that Nike had nothing to do with either the creation or sale of the shoes.\nThe product website notes that each shoe will contain \u201c60CC ink and 1 drop human blood.\u201d An animation on the product\u2019s site shows the sole of the shoe filled with a red liquid that sloshes forward and back with each step.\nThe shoe also features a pentagram in bronze with engraving that says, \u201cI SAW SATAN,\u201d \u201cMSCHF\u201d and \u201cLIL NAS X,\u201d and the words \u201cLuke 10:18\u201d are featured on the outside of the shoe near the toe. This references the verse: \u201cI saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven,\u201d which is also part of a theme in Lil Nas X\u2019s recent music video.\nAccording to the product\u2019s website, the shoe is going on sale on March 29 at 11 a.m. Eastern time and can only be purchased on MSCHF\u2019s app.\nSatan.Shoes MSCHF\u2019s limited-edition Satan Shoes.\nThe release of the Satan Shoes is referred to as MSCHF Drop #43, but on MSCHF\u2019s official website linked on Satan.Shoes, Drop #43 lists a release date of April 12 rather than March 29. However, it\u2019s followed by a countdown clock to two days from now, which is consistent with the March 29 release date.\nMSCHF\nDirectly underneath are the words \u201cTap here to get the secret drops,\u201d which connects users to MSCHF\u2019s app that can be used to buy the shoes once they \u201cdrop.\u201d\nNike Is Suing Over Trademark Infringement\nNike is suing MSCHF over trademark infringement, false designation of origin/unfair competition, trademark dilution, and common law trademark infringement.\nNike is suing MSCHF over the blood shoes: pic.twitter.com/inFLwU8k0q\n\u2014 Kevin Draper (@kevinmdraper) March 29, 2021\nSome sites are wrongly reporting this as copyright infringement, but it is a trademark infringement case.\nTHANK YOU because that had me confused too.\nSo it IS trademark infringement.

Rather than having blood and red ink in the soles, the Jesus shoes had holy water. One pair cost $3,000.\nBusiness Insider reported that the Jesus-themed shoes were bought at retail price and repurposed, and Nike had no affiliation with the shoes\u2019 creation.\nIn addition to the 60cc of holy water from the River Jordan in the soles, the Jesus shoes featured a crucifix on the top of one shoe and had been blessed by a priest.

Sign up to our newsletter, and follow us on Instagram and Twitter, so you always know where to find us.\nOver the last week, you\u2019ve likely seen Armie Hammer\u2019s name along with the word \u2018cannibal\u2019 thrown around a fair bit.\nAnd even with the year we\u2019ve already had, filled with riots on the US Capitol, Bean Dad basically starving his child for six hours, rumours about Jeffree Star and Kanye West having an affair, and Azealia Banks ~cooking~ her dead cat, the whole \u201cArmie Hammer is a cannibal\u201d rumour is still the most bonkers thing that\u2019s happened in 2021.\nRemember how celebrity news in 2016 was \"Chrissy Teigen Is HILARIOUS on Twitter, Here Are 17 Of Her Best Tweets\" and now in 2021 it's like \"Armie Hammer is a cannibal and Azealia Banks dug up her dead cat and cooked it\"\n\u2014 Tahlia Pritchard (@Tahls) January 13, 2021\nFor those playing at home, the gist of it is that Armie Hammer, the American actor in films such as Call Me By Your Name and The Social Network, has an alleged cannibal fetish which he has since vehemently denied.\nBut day by day, the number of screenshots and stories of Hammer\u2019s cannibalistic alleged fantasies have continued to pour in, even including some from his own ex-girlfriends.\nSo, let\u2019s breakdown exactly how and why did these cannibal rumours started.\n*This article includes reference of sexual assault and disturbing sex acts*\nWhy Does Everyone Think Armie Hammer Is A Cannibal?\nOver the weekend, a number of disturbing screenshots started to circulate, which showed alleged texts between Armie Hammer and a woman who claimed she was involved with the actor from 2016 to 2020 \u2014 even while he was still married to his wife of ten years, Elizabeth Chambers.\nPosted onto House of Effie, an anonymous Instagram account with over 50,000 followers, these screenshots detailed graphic messages where Hammer allegedly called himself \u201c100 percent a cannibal\u201d and said \u201cI want to eat you\u201d.\nIn other texts, Armie Hammer is said to have sent the woman a number of equally concerning messages. \u201cI need to drink your blood, I crave it,\u201d reads one text. \u201cI need to eat your entire body. I need to touch every part of you, inside and out. I want to bite pieces off of you,\u201d details another.\nAs these messages started to go viral, House of Effie claimed that at least five other women also had consensual affairs with the actor, where he told them all that wanted to \u201crun away with us\u2026 that he loved us\u201d before \u201cfucking us all in his and [his wife\u2019s] bed\u201d.\n\u201cSo we all had apartments ready for him around the world. So he met all our moms and they all loved him,\u201d the screenshot continued. \u201cHe told us all to be monogamous to him and wait for his divorce.\u201d\nCredit: House Of Effie / Instagram\nWith the women deciding to pool their messages together, House of Effie then shared one screenshot where Hammer allegedly tells one of his \u201ckittens\u201d that she will be his \u201cslave\u201d and talks about cutting off her toes.\n\u201cYou just live to obey me and be my slave. I will own you\u2026 would you come and be my property till you die?\u201d the text read. \u201cIf I wanted to cut off one of your toes and keep it with me in my pocket so I always had a piece of you in my possession?\u201d\nLater, unclear whether it is the same woman or a different one, Hammer appears to make the switch from asking, and shifts over to demanding. \u201cThose are my bones, and if I want to break one to prove it I will \u2014 fingers, toes and if you need more proof\u2026 your fucking neck,\u201d the disturbing text read.\n\u201cI was starting small,\u201d the message thread continues. \u201cIf you tell me what I can and can\u2019t break, I will break them all.\u201d\nIn another, clearly with a huge fascination for breaking bones, the actor appears to say that he is \u201cgoing to cum\u201d from the thought of breaking the woman\u2019s bones.\nAs these screenshots continued to be shared by House of Effie, it\u2019s evident that there is a clear theme in all of these exchanges: While extremely horny, the person at the other end of these texts is very aggressive and has some very questionable kinks.\nMultiple victims of Armie Hammer came out saying he used his fame to manipulate em to have sex, calling em \"kitties\" and drink their BLOOD, now WHAT IN HANNIBAL LECTER??? pic.twitter.com/LWxgZdXC4t\n\u2014 tevin (@tevinauguste) January 10, 2021\nSo, Is Armie Hammer Actually A Cannibal?\nWhile all the claims were originally from unverified screenshots by seemingly random women, the whole saga got a little more real when some of Hammer\u2019s ex-girlfriends also weighed in on the matter.\nTalking to Page Six, Hammer\u2019s latest ex, Courtney Vucekovich, shared that the viral screenshots weren\u2019t surprising to her based on her experience with him over their short relationship.\n\u201cHe said to me he wants to break my rib and barbecue and eat it,\u201d Vucekovich told Page Six. \u201cHe likes the idea of skin in his teeth. He says, \u2018I want to take a bite out of you\u2019. If I had a little cut on my hand, he\u2019d like suck it or lick it. That\u2019s about as weird as we got.\u201d\nReflecting on her experience with the actor, Vucekovich admitted that while she thought the request was weird, she never really thought about it again. She did, however, share that Hammer is \u201cgood\u201d at \u201cactive manipulation\u201d and \u201cquickly grooms you in a relationship\u201d.\n\u201cHe kind of captivates you and while being charming, he\u2019s grooming you for these things that are darker and heavier and consuming,\u201d Vucekovich said. \u201cWhen I say consuming, I mean mentally, physically, emotionally, financially, just everything.\u201d\n\u201cHe did some things with me that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou end up doing things that are very out-of-character for you, including sex acts.\u201d\nSimilarly, Jessica Ciencin Henriquez, another of the Hammer\u2019s exes, tweeted about the situation before making her Twitter account private.\nIn the tweet, Henriquez said: \u201cIf you are still questioning whether or not those Armie Hammer DMs are real (and they are) maybe you should start questioning why we live in a culture willing to give abusers the benefit of the doubt instead of victims\u201d.\nOn her Instagram story, Henriquez also shared that \u201cit takes an army to hide a predator\u201d as \u201cbehind every abuser is a team of people working hard to cover up the trail\u201d.\nEveryone: Armie Hammer is a cannibal omg\nMe: Come on guys, that\u2019s gotta be an exaggeration\nArmie Hammer: pic.twitter.com/goKoom9DmE\n\u2014 Mitch (@czarmitch) January 11, 2021\nAs a number of Hammer\u2019s exes have come forward with their own comments, concerning quotes from the actor\u2019s past interviews have also resurfaced as the cannibal rumours continue to swirl.\nIn 2013, Armie Hammer told Playboy that he used to be a \u201cdominant lover\u201d and \u201cliked the grabbing of the neck and the hair and all that\u201d, but noted that since he got married his \u201csexual appetite\u201d had changed.\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re married to a feminist, as I am, then it\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know how much we can put here without my parents being embarrassed, but I used to like to be a dominant lover,\u201d Hammer told the magazine. \u201cSo it becomes a new kind of thing that\u2019s less about \u2018I want to dominate you\u2019 and more about both of us having a really good time. It\u2019s just a different style.\u201d\n\u201cI mean that for the better \u2014 it\u2019s not like I\u2019m suffering in any way. But you can\u2019t really pull your wife\u2019s hair,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt gets to a point where you say, \u2018I respect you too much to do these things that I kind of want to do.\u2019\u201d\nAfter the interview, Armie Hammer told E! News that his explicit comments were just a result of \u201cdrinking during [the] interview\u201d and blamed his crassness on alcohol.\nBut despite the mounting evidence against him from his past lovers and own quotes, Armie Hammer finally broke his silence and called the cannibal rumours \u201cbullshit claims\u201d on January 13.\n\u201cI\u2019m not responding to these bullshit claims, but in light of the vicious and spurious online attacks against me, I cannot in good conscience now leave my children for four months to shoot a film in the Dominican Republic,\u201d Hammer told TMZ. \u201cLionsgate is supporting me in this and I\u2019m grateful to them for that.\u201d\nThe actor was actually slated to start filming for Shotgun Wedding alongside Jennifer Lopez immediately, so his role will now need to be recast.\nVariety reports that a spokesperson for the production confirms that Hammer \u201crequested to step away from the film\u201d himself, but an anonymous submission to infamous gossip Instagram account, Deux Moi, says that \u201con agency side, studio [was] trying to replace [Hammer] in a hurry\u201d following the allegations emerging.\nSo, that\u2019s 2021\u2019s latest bonkers storyline. Who knows what next week will hold?\nMichelle Rennex is a senior writer at Junkee. She tweets at @michellerennex.", "docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_22_1648697797"}

Photo: j_s_rock via Instagram\nMomo is not real. Kids being scared after seeing a picture of a freaky statue designed by a special effects company, that\u2019s real. Parents being alarmed after noticing a clip with instructions on how to slit one\u2019s wrists spliced into an otherwise innocuous YouTube video for kids. Also real. Child predation going down in YouTube comments. Real, too. But Momo, the viral meme dating to 2016 and circulating on the internet again this month, allegedly appearing in YouTube videos telling kids to kill themselves, is not real.\nThe thing is, unless you did your homework, you might have a hard time figuring that out. Meaning you really did your homework, and did it armed with a decent working knowledge of weird internet phenomena, along with a meme dictionary. Headlines across the globe have been declaring Momo a timely danger all week. \u201cViral \u2018Momo Challenge\u2019 Encouraging Child Suicide Terrifies Utah Kids.\u201d \u201cDangerous, Viral \u2018Momo Challenge\u2019 Causing Concern for Parents.\u201d \u201cWhat Is the Momo Challenge? Sick WhatsApp \u2018Suicide\u2019 Game Targeting Young Kids.\u201d ( Nieman Labs has a good roundup of local news stories peddling Momo bs .)\nKim Kardashian West screenshotted a copy-and-paste Facebook status warning about Momo, which she kindly shared with her 129 million Instagram followers without bothering to do any research. (The Facebook status she screenshotted calls out organizations including the FBI and World Star Hip Hop, but does not link to their respective pages. It\u2019s a telltale sign of copy pasta, or a status that has been copied and shared ad nauseam.) \u201cYouTube, help!\u201d Kardashian West wrote, tagging the platform.\nIt\u2019s not just worried parents and lazy media outlets spreading Momo hysteria. Police in Northern Ireland warned about the \u201c game \u201d in a Facebook post. \u201cWhen downloaded [Momo] tells your child to communicate with them via WhatsApp and a number of other widely used apps,\u201d they wrote. A sheriff\u2019s office in Florida called it an \u201c application ,\u201d describing it in a nonsensical tweet claiming Momo appears in video games, YouTube videos, and chat apps. Nobody who claims to have seen Momo can provide a link to a specific video or photos to prove they \u201csaw\u201d \u201cMomo.\u201d A colleague of mine forwarded me an email sent from her kid\u2019s public school district in New Jersey, which to be fair included a fair amount of hedging about Momo, but still told parents and guardians \u201cnews outlets report that a frightening avatar asks its viewers to perform violent and dangerous tasks\u201d and included links to several breathless pieces of coverage.\nOvernight, some of our youth in St. Johns County saw a re-emergence of the application called \u201cMomo\u201d and it has evolved. pic.twitter.com/LypnWymLJW\n\u2014 SJSO (@SJSOPIO) February 28, 2019\nEarlier this week, YouTube published a statement denying any \u201c recent evidence of videos promoting the Momo Challenge on YouTube .\u201d Then on Instagram, YouTube screenshotted Kim Kardashian West\u2019s screenshot about the Momo threat and said they were on it. The company included a link to the statement, but the text in its Instagram story just thanked Kardashian West, saying \u201cwe take these reports really seriously.\u201d YouTube didn\u2019t highlight any other information for its 18 million Instagram followers \u2014 not a \u201cthis was never a real threat\u201d or \u201cafter further investigation, we\u2019ve determined this is a hoax.\u201d Kardashian West later shared the company\u2019s reply. To anybody who didn\u2019t bother to swipe to YouTube\u2019s press release, it looked like a celebrity saved their children from a scary (and nonexistent) YouTube monster.\nA mom slid into my Instagram DMs berating my story debunking Momo and insisting she had sources inside at Google and YouTube who told her \u201coff the record\u201d that the company actually knows Momo videos exist, and how they are getting in front of children, and is \u201cbasically going to try to fix this while everyone forgets about it.\u201d (She warned me about a setting that allows YouTube Kids \u2014 the app just for children\u2019s content \u2014 to pull similar videos from the wider world of non-vetted YouTube. Here\u2019s a helpful guide from Wired on ways to keep your kids safer using the app that explains the setting fully.)\nI\u2019m all for healthy, even passionate skepticism when it comes to tech companies and what they\u2019re telling us. This is good online literacy, the kind we can only hope Generation Momo absorbs to use as adults in the real world. A different colleague told me she witnessed a fellow member of a parenting Facebook group come under attack after asking for more information from a person who claimed a friend\u2019s child had seen Momo on YouTube. The question-asker was eventually forced to recant and apologize for questioning the poster\u2019s credibility. It\u2019s this, the teetering into conspiracy-theory peddling without real proof, that is actually dangerous. It helps viral \u201cchallenge\u201d after challenge \u2014 Tide Pod eating, condom snorting \u2014 gain legitimacy. And it enables hoaxes like Momo to live a much longer life online than they should.\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter\nDaily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.\nEmail\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nTerms & Privacy Notice\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\nTags:\nmomo\ntechnology\nparenting\nhoax\nselect all\nkids these days\nMore\n+ Comments\nLeave a Comment\nMomo Hoax: Kids Won\u2019t Learn Online Smarts If Adults Don\u2019t\nMost Viewed Stories\nThe Lab-Leak Hypothesis\nThe Dirt Piles on Bill Gates Following Divorce Announcement\nBarr\u2019s Justice Department Launched Secret Attack on Trump Ally\u2019s Twitter Critic\nIs Roe v.

But the Brown family and their attorneys, who have watched body-camera and dash-cam videos of the shooting, say Brown was not a threat to the officers.\n\u201cIt was absolutely, unequivocally unjustified,\u201d attorney Chance Lynch said last week. \u201cOur legal team is more committed now to pursue justice \u2026 because what we saw today was unconstitutional and it was unjustifiable.\u201d\nDistrict Attorney says deputies who fatally shot Andrew Brown Jr. were justified\n\u2014 CNN\n11:55 a.m.\nvoting rights\nvoting rights\nIs Joe Manchin\u2019s Voting-Rights Campaign Serious?\nBy Ed Kilgore\nThe West Virginia senator is calling for bipartisan action to restore the Voting Rights Act.

Wade at the majority conservative court.\nMississippi\u2019s 15-week abortion ban, which then-Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, signed into law in 2018, made exceptions only for medical emergencies or cases in which there is a \u201csevere fetal abnormality,\u201d but not for instances of rape or incest. A federal judge in Mississippi struck down the law in November 2018, and the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling in December 2019.\nAfter being rescheduled for the court\u2019s consideration in conference over a dozen times, the case could present a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide prior to viability, which can occur at around 24 weeks of pregnancy.\nIt will be a blockbuster case, with the justices revisiting an issue that still deeply divides the country some fifty years after the landmark opinion, and with a ruling potentially coming in the middle of the 2022 midterm elections.\nSupreme Court takes up major abortion case next term that could limit Roe v.

Videos defending Slim Shady \u2014 whose real name is Marshall Mathers \u2014 are taking social media by storm.\nThe controversy kicked off in February when a \u201czoomer\u201d (or Gen Z member) posted a TikTok clip condemning the rapper\u2019s 2010 hit \u201cLove the Way You Lie,\u201d featuring Rihanna, for reportedly glorifying violence against women. They highlighted the verse \u201cIf she ever tries to f\u2013king leave again I\u2019ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire.\u201d\nThe hater\u2019s on-camera diss caused 30-somethings to \u2014 in the words of an Eminem song title \u2014 \u201cjust lose it,\u201d as many of them grew up on the 48-year-old Detroit native\u2019s tunes.\nEnlarge Image\nMillennials have rallied to Eminem\u2019s defense.

I was raised screaming them all through grade school.\u201d\n\u201cListen, little kiddies, lemme make this quite clear: This man was around before you were here.\u201d\nUndaunted, the zoomer says the lyrics are \u201cfull of hate,\u201d to which the millennial claps back, \u201cSo is my angsty little teenage soul, but look at me now. I turned out fine.\u201d\nOther Slim Shady stalwarts pointed out that \u201cLove the Way You Lie\u201d is tame compared to some of the Grammy winner\u2019s older hits, such as \u201cSuperman\u201d and \u201cGuilty Conscience\u201d \u2014 the latter depicting a man murdering his cheating wife and her lover.\nIn addition, Rihanna has said herself that the \u201cStan\u201d rapper\u2019s aforementioned verse was actually a condemnation \u2014 and not a celebration \u2014 of domestic abuse.\nFor now, it appears Eminem is safe from the social-media guillotine. Especially since, as one Twitter user noted, \u201cmore powerful people\u201d have tried and failed to cancel the hip-hop icon, including two US presidents.

Mystery Wire\nThe US government is actually gearing up to share information about the \u201creality\u201d of UFOs with the public \u2014 and not a moment too soon, says the man who claims to have run the Pentagon\u2019s UFO program for 9 years.\nFormer President Donald Trump\u2019s $2.3 trillion appropriation bill for 2021 contained a mandate that the Pentagon and spy agencies must file a report about \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena\u201d or UAP. Most of us just call them flying saucers or UFOs.\nWhatever the jargon, noted whistleblower Luis Elizondo \u2014 former head of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which operated out of the secretive fifth floor of the Pentagon\u2019s C Ring \u2014 told The Post about the resulting blockbuster document, which is reportedly slated for release in June.\nTied to the mandate, Elizondo said the upcoming report touches down on the unexplainable. Longtime UFO believers are hungry for explanations of the tic-tac-shaped objects the Navy encountered in 2004, the strange \u201ccubes within spheres\u201d seen by Navy pilots in 2014, or the mysterious black triangles continually reported around the world.\nSuch details promise to come via the much anticipated report \u2014 and at least one evolution of belief: \u201cI think the government has acknowledged the reality of UAP,\u201d Elizondo exclusively told The Post, despite signing what he refers to as a \u201clifelong\u201d NDA before he resigned from the Pentagon in 2017. \u201cI think they all want answers and I think they are all willing to ask the hard questions.\u201d\n\u2018This is not a conversation like fine wine where the longer we keep a cork on it, the better it gets.\u2019\nLuis Elizondo, former head of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program\nDuring a press conference this week, Elizondo made clear that UFOs have been observed to have qualities that are nothing less than otherworldly. He described vessels flying at 11,000 miles-per-hour and being able to turn \u201cinstantly.\u201d Providing a comparison, he explained, for our most advanced jets going at the same speed, \u201cif you wanted to make a right-hand turn, it would take you about half the state of Ohio to do it.\u201d\nHe also detailed Spielberg-worthy operational capabilities that fall into the realm of \u201ctransmedium travel.\u201d Elizondo explained that the eye-popping vessels can fly 50-feet above the Earth\u2019s surface or 80,000 feet in the sky and even submerge underwater without a compromise in performance: \u201cWhen you see that, you recognize you are dealing with a technology more advanced than ours.\u201d\nThat was despite apparent threats to security of the United States. Elizondo was particularly disturbed by the locations where UFOs or UAPs tended to hover.\nEven the way in which these inexplicable flying-machines manage to lift-off blows away rational engineering. \u201c [These] things have no wings, no cockpits, no control surfaces, no rivets in the skin, no obvious signs of propulsion \u2014 and somehow they are able to defy the natural effects of Earth\u2019s gravity,\u201d Elizondo said. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d\nThe existence of the AATIP wasn\u2019t revealed until 2017, along with what Trump described as a \u201chell of a video\u201d montage captured by the Navy featuring a dark circular object flying in front of a military jet, along with another small object racing over land at astonishing speeds in 2004 and 2015, respectively. The Department of Defense confirmed the authenticity of the footage, and a Navy spokesman confirmed the objects in the videos to be UAP.\nThe Pentagon officially released three videos taken by US Navy pilots showing mid-air encounters with what appear to be UFOs. The grainy black and white footage had previously been leaked and the Navy confirmed in 2020 that they were authentic. The Department of Defense said it \u201cwas releasing the videos in order to clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real, or whether or not there is more to the videos.\u201d\nDoD/AFP via Getty Images\nAt the time, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) took credit for arranging $22 million in annual funding for the AATIP, telling the New York Times that it was \u201cone of the good things I did in my congressional service.\u201d\nBy 2019, the Pentagon had confirmed to The Post for the first time that they research and investigate UFOs and continue to do so.\nYouTube\nNew York Post\n603K subscribers\nSubscribe\nEp. 1 | USS Nimitz, Tic Tac UFO, AATIP, FAA, the Navy and Pentagon | The Basement Office |\nWatch later\nCopy link\nInfo\nShopping\nTap to unmute\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\nMore videos\nMore videos\nYou're signed out\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

The challenge was alleged to be linked to numerous deaths around the world. But little about the \"game\" was quite as it seemed.\nThe first tasks were fairly innocuous: \"Wake up in the middle of the night\" or \"Watch a scary film\". But day by day, the tasks grew more sinister.\n\"Stand on the ledge of a tower block.\"\n\"Cut a whale into your arm.\"\nThe final challenge? A demand that the user kill themselves.\nThe challenge was alleged to have started in Russia, but reports of it soon spread to other countries: Ukraine, India and the United States.\nHundreds of deaths were reported to be linked to the so-called \"suicide game\".\nBut closer investigation has revealed something curious. The game, at least as it was initially reported, doesn't seem to have existed at all.\nOrigin story\nThe story of the Blue Whale challenge began with Rina Palenkova.\nOn 22 November 2015, Rina, a teenager living in south-eastern Russia, posted a selfie.\nIn the photo she is standing outside. A black scarf is wrapped around her mouth and nose. She is sticking her middle finger up at the camera. It looks like it's covered in dried blood.\nThe photo's caption read: \"Nya bye\". The next day, she took her own life.\nimage copyright\nGetty Images\nYou may also be interested in:\nRussian girl's suicide prompts national debate\nIs this woman's 'manspreading' video a Kremlin hoax?\nWhat is it like to prevent a suicide?\nThe memes that might get you jailed in Russia\nRina Palenkova's death was discussed in a certain type of chat room hosted by Russia's largest social network VKontakte. These forums were places where teenagers met to talk about everyday things like school and which classmates they fancied, as well as darker subject matter: depression, loneliness and suicide.\nScary stories were exchanged. The spookiness of these stories came from how real they seemed, something often achieved through fake pictures or doctored footage.\nIt is the online equivalent of the claim made by classic horror films that they are \"based on true events\". Because at the heart of any good ghost story is a sliver of plausibility.\nIt was in these groups, where the line between fact and fiction was often blurred, that users posted feverishly about Rina. In some instances, they lauded her for ending her life. Videos purporting to be her final moments were posted online.\nBut amid the rumours, there was a problem.\n\"Nobody actually knew the true story behind her suicide,\" says Daria Radchenko, a senior researcher at the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration who has looked into the so-called Blue Whale challenge.\nimage copyright\nGetty Images\nAnd shortly thereafter, Rina's story merged with other stories of teenage suicide.\nOn Christmas Day 2015, 12-year-old Angelina Davydova killed herself in the Russian city of Ryazan. A little over a fortnight later, so did Diana Kuznetsova, a teenager from the same city.\nWhen the parents examined the online accounts left behind by their daughters, they found something curious - the two girls were part of similar online groups.\nIn these groups were drawings of Rina Palenkova, posts about suicide and numerous mentions of blue whales.\nWhy blue whales?\nThere has been much speculation about how whales became linked to suicide in these groups. Some journalists claim it is because whales have been known to beach themselves, a phenomenon that has puzzled scientists. Others say that it is a reference to lyrics from a Russian rock band named Lumen.\nIt's difficult, of course, to say why certain images particularly resonate. Whales are solitary-seeming, sad-looking animals. They make for good memes. One of the most widely shared images was of a whale flying over a city at night. It captured the spirit of these groups - melancholy and quietly surreal.\nBut it wasn't until May 2016 that speculation about blue whales and suicide became part of the national conversation in Russia.\nAn article by journalist Galina Mursalieva in Novaya Gazeta, an investigative newspaper, sent the story into overdrive.\nimage copyright\nGetty Images\nMursalieva suggested that inside certain online groups, some of them with enigmatic names like \"Ocean Whales\" and \"f57\", existed a game.\nIn this game, so-called \"curators\" would set players 50 tasks over 50 days. On the last day the user was instructed to take their own life.\nThe Novaya Gazeta report estimated that 130 children might have killed themselves between November 2015 and April 2016 because of their participation in these groups. It would come to be known worldwide as the Blue Whale challenge.\nIt did not take long for the story to cause considerable alarm. The governor for Ulyanovsk in western Russia went on television to compare the Blue Whale challenge to the Islamic State group.\nSoon the panic spread outside Russia. In Georgia, US, a 16-year-old girl killed herself. It was only later when her family had learned about the Blue Whale challenge that they realised the significance of the metre-high paintings she had finished at school shortly before she died.\nThey appeared to be of blue whales.\nThen came other suicides: a boy named Isaiah Gonzalez, also in the United States, a 19-year-old in Hyderabad in India, and two Russian girls, Yulia Konstantinova and Veronika Volkova. A few days before she died, Konstantinova had posted an image of a blue whale on her Instagram account.\nThe suspect\nIn November 2016, 21-year-old Philipp Budeikin was arrested, charged with inciting teenagers to suicide.\nBudeikin appeared to admit culpability. He told Russian media outlet Saint-Petersburg.ru: \"There are people, and then there is biodegradable waste. I was cleansing our society of such people. Sometimes I start to think that it's wrong, but in the end I had the feeling I was doing the right thing.\"\nHe liked computers and was an aspiring producer of \"witch house\", an electronic music genre with occult themes. A former psychology student, the impression given by the media was that he had used highly developed tactics to manipulate teenagers into killing themselves.\nHe said he had created the game in 2013 under the name \"f57\", combining the sound of the start of his name, Philipp, and the last two digits of his phone number. On 10 May 2017 he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years in prison.\n'Shivers on my skin'\nIt seemed like an open-and-shut case. Further investigation, however, has revealed that little about the Blue Whale challenge was quite as straightforward as it seemed.\nEvgeny Berg was on his way to work when he first read about the Vkontakte chat rooms.\n\"It made a strong impression on me. It was May but it was very gloomy. I thought 'Oh my God, there is a man out there who is trying to kill a lot of children in Russia.' And I felt shivers on my skin.\"\nBerg, an investigative journalist at Meduza, a Russian-language independent media organisation, decided to dig deeper. His research took him to Sergey Pestov, the father of one of the girls who died around Christmas 2015.\nFollow BBC Trending on Facebook\nAfter his daughter's death, Pestov and his wife founded an organisation called Saving Children from Cybercrime. They produced a brochure. It implied that foreign intelligence might be to blame for their daughter's death and that operatives were destroying the Russian people by inciting their children to suicide.\nPestov became a key source of statistics for the original Novaya Gazeta piece.\n\"He used media sources and open sources to count a bunch of cases all over Russia which were, in his opinion, connected with suicide groups,\" says Evgeny Berg. \"And this number was 130.\"\nThis is the same number that was first quoted in the Novaya Gazeta piece. \"So that's where the number started\" says Berg, \"with the father of a girl who tragically died at the end of 2015.\"\nIn a story shrouded in rumour and hearsay, this 130 figure is one of the very few widely reported \"facts\". But even though it is still being used by many news outlets, the figure is tenuous. According to Evgeny Berg and Meduza, it originates with a parent trying to unravel the reasons behind a personal tragedy.\nThe Novaya Gazeta article has been viewed over one and a half million times, according to the paper.\nMore from BBC Trending\nDownload our podcast - from the BBC World Service\nReporter responds\nWe took Evgeny Berg's allegations - that the foundations of the Novaya Gazeta article were, at best, unsteady - directly to the reporter, Galina Mursalieva. She rejected the claim that her report relied on a single flawed statistic.\n\"This number 130 wasn't based on the conclusions of one father who lost his child,\" says Mursalieva. \"No. This is absolutely wrong. It was based on the conclusions of over 200 parents who lost their children. The father of the girl who died just helped during that period of time. I don't have any reason not to trust them. I checked many things.\"\nMursalieva had worked on the story for months and included interviews with the parents of deceased children and experts in law and psychology. She says she published it because she wanted to spur into action investigators who she thought weren't taking the problem seriously enough.\nBut despite the considerable column inches dedicated to the \"challenge\" over the years, not a single suicide has so far been proved to be linked to these groups, neither by journalists nor police.\n\"There have actually been way more than 130 cases,\" claims Mursalieva. \"But tell me - who could confirm that this happened? How can it be confirmed?\"\nThat seems to be the crux of it. How can the cause of a suicide ever be \"proved\"? It might be more accurate to say that teenagers suffering from depression, some of them suicidal, could be drawn to groups that deal with that topic. These same children may use similar images, like blue whales, to articulate their feelings online.\nimage copyright\nGetty Images\nBlue Whale: Fact or Fiction?\nWith its surreal memes and creepy stories that blur fact and fiction, the subculture of teenage messaging boards is easy for adults to misinterpret. It is possible that journalists and concerned parents accessed these groups and brought together disparate elements into a story that wasn't really there.\nThat reading tallies with the findings of Alexandra Arkhipova, a professor in Folklore Studies at the Russian State University for the Humanities. When she and her colleagues entered the online groups alleged to be connected with the Blue Whale challenge, they found something strange.\n\"All of these 'curators',\" says Arkhipova, \"turned out to be children aged 12 to 14.\"\nFar from being manipulative adults, all the curators seemed to be just kids who had read or heard about the game. In fact, Arkhipova's research suggests that the \"challenge\" might not have really existed in any substantial way before the Novaya Gazeta article was published.\nArkhipova says that the \"curators\" she came across online were copycats, acting out step by step the parts of a game that was being widely reported in the press.\n\"In all these groups people, mainly young people, were waiting for this game,\" says Arkhipova. \"This game never starts.\"\nPrisoner\nBut where does that leave the story of Philipp Budeikin, the man who confessed to creating the game? Oddly, it might have something to do with his music career.\nFriends of Budeikin, speaking to the investigative journalist Evgeny Berg, disputed the claim that he is an evil mastermind.\nIn fact, they say that he filled online groups with \"shock\" content related to Rina Palenkova and suicide in order to get as many followers as possible - and then advertise his music.\nIt is a common practice on VKontakte, where people exploit access to a large amount of followers to advertise other projects or sell products.\nWhen Budeikin was arrested, there were 15 charges against him. By the following month, all but one had collapsed.\nThe truth at the heart of the Blue Whale challenge is surely both more sad and more mundane than the breathless articles might have us believe. Russia's suicide rates are high especially among the young. It has one of the highest rates of adolescent suicide in the world.\nYes, some teenagers appear to have been drawn into online forums where suicide was being discussed. And in those forums, blue whale memes were being shared. But the idea of a sinister game, one that slowly roped in vulnerable teens and led them down an increasingly tortured path to suicide, seems to be a simplistic explanation for a complex problem.\nThere is no silver bullet for tackling suicide amongst teenagers. Nor is there a bogeyman that can be locked up to prevent it.\nDo you have a story for us?

He then became one of the country's most well-known criminal suspects. Now he's an international fugitive.\nCarlos Ghosn, the multi-millionaire former boss of Nissan, spent months preparing to stand trial on financial misconduct charges. At least, that was what the Japanese authorities were led to believe.\nHe posted 1bn yen (\u00a36.8m; $8.9m) in bail in April. He was monitored by a 24-hour camera installed outside his house. His use of technology was heavily restricted and he was banned from travelling abroad.\nThen, in a move that left Japan red-faced and his own legal team baffled, he appeared in Lebanon on New Year's Eve. \"I have escaped injustice and political persecution,\" he declared in a statement.\n\"I am dumbfounded,\" his lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters in Tokyo shortly after learning of Mr Ghosn's flight. \"I want to ask him, 'How could you do this to us?'\"\nAnother pressing question is: how did he do it at all?\n'Mission impossible'\nOn 8 January, in his first public comments since fleeing, Mr Ghosn refused to say how he managed to leave Japan.\nHe told a news conference in Beirut that he would clear his name despite being on the run, and joked that he was used to \"mission impossible\".\nReports suggest that description may not be wide of the mark.\nThe former CEO's getaway from Tokyo to Beirut was meticulously planned over a period of several weeks or months, according to numerous media reports.\nimage copyright\nAFP\nimage caption\nMr Ghosn walked out of his Tokyo house despite cameras and other security measures\nJapanese broadcaster NHK reported that CCTV footage showed Mr Ghosn leaving his house and walking about 800m to a nearby hotel in the middle of the afternoon on 29 December. There he joined two men, thought to be Americans.\nThe three then boarded a train to Osaka and went to a hotel near Kansai international airport. Two hours later, the two men were seen leaving with two large containers, according to NHK. No cameras captured Mr Ghosn - the implication being that he was inside one of the containers.\nThe Wall Street Journal, citing unidentified sources, said a team was carefully assembled to carry out the plot. The group reportedly included accomplices in Japan who transported Mr Ghosn from his house and onto a private jet bound for Istanbul. From there, he continued his journey to Beirut where he arrived in the early hours of 30 December.\nThe plane tracking site FlightRadar24 showed a Bombardier Challenger private jet arriving at Beirut-Rafic Hariri international airport shortly after 04:00 local time. Mr Ghosn then met his wife Carole, who was born in the city and was heavily involved in the operation, the Wall Street Journal says.\nimage copyright\nGetty Images\nimage caption\nThe ex-Nissan boss was pictured leaving prison while disguised as a workman in March 2019\nAn earlier MTV Lebanon report, which now appears to be inaccurate, suggested Mr Ghosn fled with the assistance of a paramilitary group who were disguised amongst a band of musicians.\nThe 65-year-old was said to have hid in a large musical instrument case. The broadcaster provided no proof for this theory which, unsurprisingly, spread rapidly across social media.\nThe car industry's driven 'cost killer'\nCarlos Ghosn and Japan's 'hostage justice' system\nFour charts on the scandal\nMr Ghosn's wife, Carole, told Reuters news agency that reports of the musical escape were \"fiction\".\nDonning a spy-movie disguise is not beyond Mr Ghosn, however. In March, in a bid to throw journalists off his scent, he left prison disguised as a construction worker. He was quickly identified and his lawyer soon apologised for the \"amateur plan\".\nThe role of Carole Ghosn\nMr Ghosn denies his wife helped him, insisting he organised his escape \"alone\" and she has declined to provide details of the escape.\nBut several reports have said Carole Ghosn was a major figure behind the plan for her husband to get out of Japan. She spoke to him for more than an hour on 24 December, Mr Ghosn's Japanese lawyer said. The couple had previously been banned from meeting or communicating under Mr Ghosn's bail conditions.\nAfter her husband arrived in Lebanon, Mrs Ghosn told the Wall Street Journal that their reunion was \"the best gift of my life\".\n2.43.0.9b7d022\nPlay\n8\nUse the arrow keys to increase and decrease the volume\n/\nEnter full screen\nTurn subtitles on and open subtitles settings menu\nSubtitles\nOFF\nAa\nAa\nAa\nAa\nAa\nOpen playback settings menu for autoplay and video quality settings\nPlayback settings\nAutoplay\nPlay next item automatically\nOFF\nVideo quality\nHighest available\nCurrently unavailable\nLow\nMedium\nHighest available\nAutomatically selects the best quality available\nOpen playback speed menu\n1x\nPlayback speed\n0.5x\n0.8x\n1x\n1.5x\n2x\nCast this programme\nOpen Picture in Picture mode\nGet embed code\nUse the arrow keys to forward and rewind\nG\nmedia caption\nMr Ghosn's wife Carole told the BBC in June that Japanese officials were trying to humiliate her husband\nMr Ghosn has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. He has also said media speculation that his wife had played a role in his escape was \"inaccurate and false\", adding: \"I alone arranged for my departure.\"\nSeveral media reports said private security operatives helped smuggle Mr Ghosn out of house arrest.\nThe Financial Times reported that the operatives had been planning the escape for months, and had allegedly split into several teams working in different countries. Two people familiar with the situation said the preparations were assisted by Mr Ghosn's Japanese supporters.\nThe former Nissan boss made his escape by flying out of Japan's Osaka airport on a private jet, the newspaper reported. It said Mr Ghosn was not required to wear any electronic tags while on bail.\nTwo unnamed sources close to Mr Ghosn told Reuters news agency that even the pilot of the private jet was unaware of Mr Ghosn's presence on board.\nThree passports\nQuestions remain about the documents Mr Ghosn used to enter Lebanon. He holds three passports - Brazilian, French and Lebanese - but his legal team maintain that they were in possession of all of them when he left Japan.\nIt is not known whether Mr Ghosn was holding duplicate passports - as businesspeople are sometimes allowed to do. It has also been reported that he may have had a diplomatic passport issued by Lebanon although this has not been confirmed.\nWhile the French newspaper Le Monde said he travelled on an ID card, others have reported that he may have used a French passport or even forged documents.\nA spokesperson for Mr Ghosn told the Financial Times he had used a French passport to enter Lebanon but would not disclose how he had left Japan.\nGhadi Khoury, from the Lebanese foreign ministry, said the former Nissan boss had entered the country on a French passport and Lebanese ID, according to the newspaper.\nimage copyright\nAFP\nimage caption\nMr Ghosn grew up in Beirut and remains a popular figure in the city\nThe embarrassment caused by Mr Ghosn's flight soon sparked a reaction from Japan. One Japanese politician asked whether he \"had the support of some country\". A former governor of Tokyo was more forthright, accusing Lebanon of direct involvement.\nMr Ghosn grew up in Lebanon, owns property there and is a popular figure. He even appeared on one of the country's postage stamps.\nThe two Reuters sources said the Lebanese ambassador to Japan had visited him every day while he was in detention. The ambassador has not publicly responded to this claim.\nThe Lebanese government has denied any involvement in Mr Ghosn's escape.\n\"The government has nothing to do with [Mr Ghosn's] decision to come,\" Lebanese minister Salim Jreissati was quoted as saying by the New York Times. \"We don't know the circumstances of his arrival.\"\nMr Khoury told the Financial Times that Lebanon \"had asked for [Mr Ghosn's] extradition\", but said the government had not had any involvement in his plan to escape.\nFrance and Turkey have also said they were unaware of Mr Ghosn's plan.\nWhat now?\nOn 2 January Lebanon received a \"red notice\" from Interpol for Mr Ghosn's arrest - a request to detain a person pending extradition, surrender or other legal action. However, there is no extradition deal between Japan and Lebanon.\nFrance, meanwhile, has said it would not extradite him if he arrived in the country as he is a French citizen.\nTurkey has launched an investigation into Mr Ghosn's reported stopover in Istanbul. Local media say seven people have been arrested - four pilots, a cargo company manager and two airport workers.\nJapan gives millions in aid to Lebanon and is likely to want Mr Ghosn returned. But it faces questions about how such a high-profile suspect was able to get out of the country in the first place.", "docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_34_7751734"}

Outside experts on microwaves and the mysterious \u201cHavana syndrome,\u201d meanwhile, dismissed it as implausible. One scientist dubbed it \u201cscience fiction.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIn many ways, what we are saying is the US government needs to take this on in a more deliberate and comprehensive manner,\u201d said panel chair David Relman, an infectious disease expert at Stanford. \u201cWhat is needed is an all-of-government effort to not just study what happened but to anticipate what the future holds.\u201d\nThe State Department praised the release, saying in a statement released to BuzzFeed News that the report \u201ccan add to the data and analyses that may help us come to an eventual conclusion as to what transpired.\u201d\nThe statement added, \u201cAmong a number of conclusions, the report notes that the \u2018constellation of signs and symptoms\u2019 is consistent with the effects of pulsed radio frequency energy. We would note that \u2018consistent with\u2019 is a term of art in medicine and science that allows plausibility but does not assign cause.\u201d\nRoughly 35 diplomats reported the mysterious injuries starting in late 2016, marring US diplomatic relations with Cuba for much of the Trump administration.\nIn 2017, the State Department first publicized concerns about US Embassy personnel in Havana who had reported hearing loud noises and then experiencing symptoms including ear pain, headaches, and head pressure. Early news reports cited sonic weapons as the cause, triggering deafness, inner ear damage, and a concussion-like syndrome of brain damage \u2014 all dismissed by the new NAS report \u2014 which Rex Tillerson, then the head of the State Department, called \u201c health attacks \u201d on the diplomats and their families.\nAdvertisement\nOther theories circulated suggesting that the mysterious illnesses were caused by cricket noises triggering mass hysteria or Russian spies somehow zapping diplomats. In 2019, the State Department asked the NAS to review the illnesses with the limited information available and with an emphasis on advising how to collect medical information for any future clusters of cases. The panel met three times in the last year, hearing from medical teams who had treated or examined some affected patients; it also reviewed reports by the CDC and the National Institutes of Health and heard testimony from eight patients in closed sessions.\nBut the panel was hamstrung by a lack of information about the people involved, the report said, because of security and medical privacy laws. The medical testing data provided was not thorough enough, since it was collected to help treat the patients rather than investigate an outbreak of injuries.\n\u201cWe didn't have information about individual people, including who was first affected, who was later affected, what their connections were,\u201d said panel member Jeffrey Staab, a professor of psychiatry at the Mayo Clinic. Given those limits, the panel focused on the acute, immediate symptoms reported among the diplomats in Havana \u2014 loud sounds, pressure, vibrations, ear pain, and headaches \u2014 as most distinctive and informative about the possible explanations. The panel also excluded recent reports of similar injuries in Canadian tourists and US diplomats in China.\n\u201cThere are real holes in the information,\u201d Staab said. \u201cEven if we had all the security clearances to see everything about everyone, there would be holes in the information.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThose same limits constrained what the scientists could say were plausible explanations for the injuries, panel members told BuzzFeed News. A theory that the mysterious illness was caused by an infectious disease, such as the Zika virus, was deemed \u201chighly unlikely\u201d \u2014 and a more recent explanation that the outbreak was caused by pesticide poisoning was determined to be \u201cnot likely,\u201d though the scientists pointed out that no blood samples remained from the patients to thoroughly rule it out.\n\u201cEven if we had all the security clearances to see everything about everyone, there would be holes in the information.\u201d\nThe scientists also considered a third theory that mass psychological illness was the cause. In this scenario, a cluster of acute symptoms is followed by wider numbers of chronic conditions \u2014 notably persistent dizziness, difficulty thinking, insomnia, and headaches \u2014 mirroring past outbreaks of injuries spread by social contagion. However, without data on the individuals and their contacts to map out social networks, Staab said, the panel couldn\u2019t draw a definite conclusion. \u201cThe hardest to set aside is the psychological, social explanation,\u201d Relman said.\nThat left a final theory that the illnesses were caused by a \u201cdirected radio frequency energy attack.\u201d Based on a real phenomenon called \"the Frey effect,\" where beams of pulsed microwaves aimed at a person\u2019s ears could produce clicking noises that only the person targeted can hear, the panel suggested a \u201cFrey-like effect\u201d was the \u201cmost plausible\u201d of the explanations considered.\n\u201cIt's a little dramatic. But first of all, something important and real happened to these people,\u201d Relman said. \u201cWe looked at possible mechanisms and found that one was more plausible than the others and entirely consistent with some of the most distinct clinical findings.\u201d\nThe report concluded that a microwave attack could cause a compensatory balance and dizziness syndrome afterward, accompanied by depression triggered by their injuries. Chronic injuries often have psychological aspects that shouldn\u2019t be discounted as real symptoms, Staab said.\nSome of the report's most important findings were its recommendations to the State Department on how to investigate any future clusters thoroughly, with experts from many disciplines instead of just physicians familiar with brain injuries. \u201cWhatever happens, we can\u2019t let this happen again,\u201d Staab said.\nHowever, experts in both microwaves and group psychology were highly critical of the report\u2019s conclusions.\n\u201cThe report does not make a coherent argument why microwaves should be involved,\u201d said University of Pennsylvania bioengineer Kenneth Foster, who first described the mechanism behind the Frey effect in 1974. The effect requires very high power levels to produce barely audible sounds, he said, and it\u2019s not known to cause injuries. \u201cMaybe someone went to the trouble to truck in a large microwave transmitter to cause the employees to hear \u2018clicks,\u2019 but there are simpler ways to harass people than that,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is not science but science fiction,\u201d said UCLA neurologist Robert Baloh, coauthor of Havana Syndrome: Mass Psychogenic Illness and the Real Story Behind the Embassy Mystery and Hysteria. News reports alone, not considered by the panel, paint a picture of illnesses spreading through the patients in ways that look a lot like past group psychology outbreaks, Baloh said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of misunderstanding these symptoms are real, people are really injured, even among physicians,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThis is not science, but science fiction.\u201d\nNeuroscientist Mitchell Joseph Vald\u00e9s Sosa of the Cuba Neuroscience Center said the report was a step in the right direction since it invalidated the wilder theories of sonic weapons and brain damage. The findings resemble a 2018 Cuban Academy of Sciences report, coauthored by Sosa, which suggested that early injuries among a few people likely spread by mass psychology to more people throughout the wider diplomatic community. \u201cWe don\u2019t agree with the radio frequency pulse finding, of course,\u201d Sosa said, \u201cbut this is the first time we have US experts acknowledging psychogenic effects could be important.\u201d\nHe noted the Cuban hotels and neighborhoods where the microwave attacks supposedly took place are in crowded, open spaces, making it unlikely such a small group would be affected or that the attacks could go unnoticed.\nThe Cuban Academy of Sciences did reach out to the panel to present its surveys of the neighborhoods near where the injuries were reported, Sosa added. But it was told the panel\u2019s contract didn\u2019t allow for consulting with the Cubans.\nNone of the panel members seem to have much experience in biological effects of microwaves, which might explain their willingness to consider a Frey-like effect plausible, said Old Dominion University bioengineer Andrei Pakhomov, who said he was skeptical based on his four decades of research in the area. \u201cThere are many reports of biological effects from radio frequency fields, but there are no reliable ones.\u201d\nDespite the reported suspicions of Russian spies somehow building on Soviet-era research to create such a weapon, Pakhomov, a Russian emigre, said the field is now defunct in Russia.\n\u201cI know all the people there who could have done something in this area,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are all retired or out of science.\u201d\nTwitter\nTweet\nFacebook\nShare\nCopy\nCopy\nDan Vergano is a science reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Washington, DC.\nContact Dan Vergano at dan.vergano@buzzfeed.com.\nGot a confidential tip?

Her father has controlled her career and finances since 2008, a position she's been fighting against for years.\nThe fight is back in the spotlight following the release of a New York Times documentary, \" Framing Britney Spears ,\" which follows the beloved pop star's rise to fame, public breakdown and recent comeback. The documentary also focuses on the past media coverage of Spears, which many now consider misogynistic.\nFor years, fans have used the hashtag #FreeBritney to support the singer's desire to leave her conservatorship, a court-appointed role that gives her father, Jamie Spears, the power to control her estate. Britney's lawyers have said she will no longer perform as long as her father is in charge.\nBoth sides returned to court Thursday to determine the roles her father and a financial company, acting as a co-conservator, will play in handling her estate. The next hearing is scheduled for March 17.\nWhat is a conservatorship?\nA conservatorship is legally defined as a court case where a judge appoints an individual or organization, called the conservator, to care for someone who \"cannot care\" for themselves or who cannot manage their own finances, according to the Judicial Branch of California.\nZoe Brennan-Krohn, a staff attorney with the ACLU, told CBS News conservatorship laws will vary from state to state, making it difficult to determine exactly how many exist across the country.\nThe law supports conservatorships when less restrictive options are ruled out, Brennan-Krohn said, but too often, they're granted as a \"first resort\" when someone encounters difficulties or experiences age-related disabilities.\nBrennan Krohn said Britney is \"one of the untold thousands nationwide\" under a guardianship or conservatorship, calling her case unique because of her fame and fortune. \"But it is also interesting because it is, in some ways, quite typical. We see across the country that people get into conservatorships and guardianships that they can't get out of.\"\nHow did we get here?\nIn 2008, James Spears, who goes by Jamie, was granted the conservatorship after Britney purportedly struggled with mental health issues and was hospitalized. After Britney was released, a Los Angeles court made the conservatorship permanent, giving her father and another co-conservator power over her finances and medical decisions.\nJamie argues that his conservatorship is working. Under his order, his legal team says, Britney's estate has gone from being in debt to having a valuation of more than $60 million.\nIn November 2020, his legal team said Jamie has worked hard to restore Britney to \"good health, reunite her with her children, and revive her career.\"\n\"Throughout his service as Conservator, Mr. Spear's sole motivation has been his unconditional love for his daughter and a fierce desire to protect her from those trying to take advantage of her,\" Jamie's legal team wrote. \"He wants his daughter to be happy, healthy, protected and thriving. His love for Britney is a material factor in how he has been able to turn her estate around from being in the red to what it is now.\"\nJamie Spears in 2012 and Britney Spears in 2017. AP\nWhy does Britney want out?\nIn August 2020, the pop star's court-appointed attorney said Britney \"strongly opposed\" her father's position as the sole conservator of her estate and asked the court to limit his control. Her attorney, Samuel D. Ingham III, said Britney \"strongly prefers to have a qualified corporate fiduciary in the role\" and she's made several attempts to do so.\nBritney requested that Jamie's temporary replacement, Jodi Montgomery, be named the permanent conservator of her person. Montgomery, a professionally licensed conservator, temporarily took over the role in 2019 when Jamie volunteered to briefly step down, citing health reasons.\nIn November of last year, a judge granted the singer's wish to appoint an outside financial group, Bessemer Trust, as co-conservator. She is still requesting the court to remove her father and allow Bessemer Trust to become the sole conservator of her estate \u2014 something Jamie and his legal team have continued to fight, arguing that his powers had been stripped away.\nIn court, Ingram reportedly called Britney a \"high-functioning conservatee\" who deserves to know what action her father might be taking over her estate. He also said his client is \"afraid of her father\" and that she had not spoken to him for a long time.\nOn February 3, the singer's counsel said \"it would be highly detrimental to Britney's interests\" to allow her father to be the sole person in charge of her estate.\nAttorneys for both Britney and Jamie Spears did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.\nBrennan-Krohn, who works on the ACLU's Disability Rights Program, said there are certain risks that could come with the appointment, including \"financial, physical and emotional abuse.\"\n\"Even when there is no abuse, conservatorships limit a person's ability to advocate for themselves, learn from their decisions and mistakes, and grow and develop. There is a risk in being told that your opinions, your likes and dislikes, don't matter \u2014 it makes it harder to stand up to abuse or neglect,\" she said.\n\"In any conservatorship, we would want to know that the real risks (and benefits) of both conservatorship and its alternatives have been seriously weighed.\"\nBritney Spears performs in 2016. Christopher Polk/Getty\nWhat has Britney said about the case?\nBritney has remained tight-lipped throughout the legal battle, speaking only through her legal team, and by making subtle comments over the years.\nThe Times series plays a clip from the MTV documentary \" Britney: For The Record ,\" where Britney spoke about the limits to her personal freedom. It's unclear if she was speaking directly to the conservatorship.\n\"If I wasn't under the restraints that I'm under right now, you know, with all the lawyers and doctors and people analyzing me every day and all that kind of stuff, if that wasn't there, I'd feel so liberated and feel like myself. I'm kind of stuck in this place, and it's like, how do you deal? I just cope with it every day,\" she told the interviewer. \"When I tell them the way I feel, it's like they hear me but they're really not listening. They're hearing what they want to hear. They're not listening to what I'm telling them. It's bad\u2026 I'm sad.\"\nWhen asked if her life was out of control, she disagreed and said, \"It's too in control. There's no excitement. There's no passion. It's like 'Groundhog's Day,' every day.\"\nOn Tuesday, Britney tweeted a video of her performing her song \"Toxic,\" along with the message: I'll always love being on stage .... but I am taking the time to learn and be a normal person... I love simply enjoying the basics of everyday life.\"\nIn a separate tweet, she wrote: \"Each person has their story and their take on other people's stories !!!!

But when children get sucked into trends and challenges that aren't meant for anyone, let alone kids, to attempt, things can turn dangerous quickly. That's what happened when one 10-year-old girl attempted the Blackout Challenge on TikTok and died of asphyxiation. Sadly, her death isn't the only one to come from someone trying out a particular trend or challenge from the app. On March 23, another child ended up fighting for their life.\nArticle continues below advertisement\nSomehow, among the silly baby videos and harmless pranks are the kinds of challenges that remind you why kids should not have solo access to TikTok. But, like YouTube and other social media platforms, it can be hard to totally protect children from the dangerous aspects all of the time.\nAnd even though the Blackout Challenge isn't as widespread as some others, it is gaining a bad reputation.\nSource: TikTok\nArticle continues below advertisement\nWhat is the Blackout Challenge on TikTok?\nSimilar to the Pass Out Challenge that once gained traction among users, the Blackout Challenge encourages people to asphyxiate themselves however possible until they pass out. The idea is that they wake up moments later, but it's incredibly dangerous and should be avoided. In fact, if you see someone on TikTok participating in the challenge or urging other users to try it out, you should report the video right away.\nIn February 2020, kids were trying the Pass Out Challenge, which was essentially the same thing, on TikTok. In that challenge, teens moved their heads from side to side as fast as they could until the movement caused them to pass out. They would wake up soon after and record their results on TikTok. It, too, was dangerous and one of many trends that teens and young kids especially are warned to avoid.\nArticle continues below advertisement\nSource: Twitter\nA young girl died from trying the dangerous TikTok Blackout Challenge trend.\nOn Jan. 21, 2021, a 10-year-old girl from Italy was reported brain dead after being rushed to the hospital after she tried the Blackout Challenge. She initially went into cardiac arrest after trying the deadly trend and died not long after. Like the Pass Out Challenge, which is less severe on paper but still dangerous, the Blackout Challenge can have lasting consequences.\nArticle continues below advertisement\nExperts warn that partaking in these types of TikTok trends can lead to fainting, seizures, brain damage, and, yes, death. Users might not always end up permanently injured because of these types of trends, but because of the very real possibility that it could happen, the Blackout Challenge and those like it are too dangerous to try to recreate.\nSource: Twitter\nArticle continues below advertisement\nAnother child is fighting for his life due to the TikTok Blackout Challenge.\nDespite its dangers and the TikTok users reporting videos of the TikTok Blackout Challenge, it's still out there for kids to find. And as of March 2021, another young boy has ended up in the hospital because of it. A family friend shared to The Denver Channel, \"I can't even describe the grief and the devastation. Nobody could ever imagine this would happen to a 12-year-old.\"\nJoshua Haileyesus is only 12 years old and was home with his brother when he tried out the deadly trend. His parents said he learned a lot of great things from social media like cooking and playing guitar, but they've now experienced the dangerous side of it as well. His father made clear, \"I want others to see what I'm going through, learn for their children.\"\nArticle continues below advertisement\nSource: Twitter\nNow, Joshua is brain dead, staying at Children's Hospital Colorado with his friends and family praying for him to survive. Joshua's father compared social media to guns because of the power it has to take unsuspecting lives. \"It's not a joke at all,\" he said. \"And you can treat it as if somebody is holding a gun. This is how dangerous this is.\"\nArticle continues below advertisement\nHow do you report the Blackout Challenge?\nIf you come across a TikTok video wherein someone is trying the Blackout Challenge or promoting it in some way, you can report the video and help in getting similar content removed from the app. To do this, click on the arrow on the right-hand side of the screen while on the video you want to report. From there, click on the flag that says \"report,\" and select \"suicide, self-harm, and dangerous acts\" from the list.\nIf you or someone you know are experiencing suicidal thoughts, call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255 or text HOME to the Crisis Text Line at 741741.\nAdvertisement", "docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_38_227081897"}

The years-long fraud and the largest college admissions scandal ever prosecuted made splashy headlines \u2014largely about actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman\u2019s arrests and convictions. But Netflix\u2019s new documentary film Operation Varsity Blues, by Fyre director Chris Smith, refocuses the attention onto William \u201cRick\u201d Singer\u2014the college admissions counselor and confessed criminal mastermind behind the entire scheme. While many of the parents and college employees indicted in the scandal have been charged and sentenced, Singer, who pled guilty to all charges brought against him, is yet to be sentenced.\nIn 2011, Rick Singer started a for-profit college counseling company called the Key. His business \u2014which he called the \u201cside door\u201d admission to elite colleges\u2014was twofold. One part consisted of facilitating cheating on ACT and SAT entrance exams by having students fake the need for extra time and then having them take the exams with a proctor whom he hired. Singer\u2019s exam proctor would correct his clients\u2019 answers without their knowledge after they finished in order to adjust their scores as needed. The other portion of his criminal enterprise was bribing college athletics directors and coaches with donations to their programs as well as personal payments in order for them to recruit his clients as athletes. As the Netflix documentary explains, the athletic recruitment process is left largely up to a college\u2019s athletics staff, who simply present their recruits to the school for approval every year. With a little photoshop on Singer\u2019s end, all his client had to do was never show up for practice once at college (which they would not have known to do anyway, as the children were for the most part completely unaware what their parents had orchestrated with Singer behind the scenes). Parents paid anywhere from $200,000 to $6.5 million to guarantee admission at elite colleges and universities such as the University of Southern California, Yale, Stanford, and Georgetown for their children through donations to Singer\u2019s fake charity called the Key Worldwide Foundation, which he would then donate to college athletics programs or wire to coaches directly.\nThis content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\nFrom 2011 to 2019, Singer\u2019s \u201cside door\u201d was open for highly profitable business, in which Singer himself collected 25 million dollars. (According to the documentary, the \u201cback door\u201d is a much larger donation than what Singer charged, made directly to the school like, for example, Jared Kushner\u2019s parents the year before he was accepted to Harvard. This method is not only more expensive than Singer\u2019s, but also cannot provide a guaranteed acceptance.) But the scheme began to teeter when a financial executive named Morrie Tobin, who was being investigated in a different financial fraud case, offered investigators a tip about a Yale soccer coach accepting bribes in exchange for admission in an attempt to create goodwill with the FBI. The tip eventually led them to Rick Singer, who was caught in September of 2018.\nBut in order to spare himself as much as possible, Singer agreed to work with investigators to bring his entire Ponzi scheme down with him. Wearing a wire, Singer made phone calls and in-person visits to his past and present clientele to discuss a fabricated audit of his foundation so that they would implicate themselves by confirming knowledge of phony donations. He did successfully warn or alert some that he was wearing a wire, which he confessed to in court. Ultimately, though, the government\u2019s case was built on this series of recordings Singer made, and Singer himself pleaded guilty to all charges brought against him\u2014racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and obstruction of justice\u2014as well on March 12, 2019. His cooperation and guilty plea will result in a lesser sentence for him when his sentencing date comes. The trials and sentencing proceedings in this sprawling case are ongoing, and Singer's case status simply states that \u201cthere is no sentencing hearing scheduled at this time.\u201d According to CNN, he faces a maximum sentence of 65 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a $1.25 million fine.\nRick Singer leaving federal court in Boston on Tuesday, March 12, 2019, after he pleaded guilty to charges against him.\nNETFLIX\nThe FBI began making arrests in March 2019, starting with actress Felicity Huffman. Her and Lori Loughlin, along with other high-powered and influential parents, were charged with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Mark Riddell, the exam proctor who facilitated the cheating on college entrance exams, was charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud, honest services mail fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Coaches and athletics directors at top U.S. schools were charged with racketeering conspiracy, and some with mail fraud and wire fraud, too. A full list of charges and sentences in the case can be found here.\nFelicity Huffman, who was accused of paying $15,000 to Key Worldwide Foundation to facilitate her daughter cheating on a college entrance exam, pleaded guilty on May 13, 2019. She was sentenced to two weeks in prison, one year of supervised release, 250 hours of community service, and fined $30,000. Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannullo were accused of \u2018donating\u2019 $500,000 to have their daughters Olivia Jade and Isabella Rose recruited to USC's crew team. Loughlin initially pleaded not guilty, but in May 2020 changed her plea. She pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, and was sentenced to two months in prison, two years of supervised release, a fine of $150,000, and 100 hours of community service. Olivia Jade, a popular YouTuber before the case broke, went on Jada Pinkett-Smith\u2019s Red Table Talk in December 2020 to address the scandal for the first time.\nMany accused in the largest college admissions scandal case ever prosecuted still await their sentences. As Operation Varsity Blues shows, Rick Singer is one of them. He reportedly enrolled at Grand Canyon University in November 2019 to work towards a doctorate in psychology in an \u201ceffort to change his life for the future.\u201d Although his lawyer said he had hoped to be nearly finished with the degree when he was sentenced in 2021 or 2022, Singer dropped out in July of 2020 after completing a total of five courses.\nLauren Kranc Lauren Kranc is an editorial assistant at Esquire, where she covers pop culture and television, with entirely too narrow of an expertise on Netflix dating shows.\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

Find out if they really deliver.\nBy Karen Asp\nLast Updated: May 6, 2015\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nCopy Link\nFact-Checked\nOxygen bars don\u2019t replace medical-grade oxygen. Kimihiro Koshino/Getty Images\nA new wave of oxygen bars is popping up across the country. Originally popular in the 1990s, these bars essentially market and sell air, and some make health claims for their inhaled product.\nClaims for canned, inhaled oxygen are intoxicating, to say the least. Who doesn\u2019t want to relieve stress, ease muscle aches, increase energy, concentrate and focus more effectively, sleep better, slow the aging process, and recover quickly from jet lag and hangovers?\nIf all of that sounds too good to be true, it undoubtedly is, which is why you should cast a doubtful eye on these oxygen products. Here\u2019s what you need to know before you inhale.\nBusting the Oxygen Bubble\nRecreational oxygen therapy rests on a relatively simple premise: By delivering higher concentrations of oxygen than you would normally get from the air around you, you reap the above health rewards.\nJust how much more oxygen do you get? While the air you breathe is made up of 21 percent oxygen, many oxygen bars and canned oxygen products claim to give you about 95 percent oxygen.\nIn reality, most of these products, especially those offered in oxygen bars, deliver only about 35 percent to 40 percent oxygen, says Frank LoVecchio, DO, MPH, co-medical director of the Banner Good Samaritan Poison and Drug Information Center at Banner Health and professor of emergency medicine at the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix.\nWhile that\u2019s still more oxygen than you get from the air around you, the truth is that healthy people just don't need the extra oxygen. \u201cHumans have evolved to live in an atmosphere with 21 percent oxygen,\u201d says Jason Turowski, MD, pulmonologist with the Cleveland Clinic Respiratory Institute in Ohio.\n\u201cOnce your blood gets enough oxygen, you can\u2019t load any more onto your red blood cells,\u201d Dr. Turowski says. He likens it to trying to squeeze more people onto an already-packed New York City subway car.\nThe one exception for otherwise healthy individuals? Athletes doing vigorous exercise, like football players; they might have just run 70 yards for a touchdown and then suck oxygen on the sidelines. \u201cThat oxygen will make that athlete feel better, but it won\u2019t do anything for the average individual,\u201d says Norman H. Edelman, MD, senior scientific advisor with the American Lung Association and professor of preventive medicine, internal medicine, and physiology and biophysics at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.\nThe numerous health claims these oxygen bars tout simply don\u2019t hold merit, some experts say. \u201cThe reason for your hangover or muscle pain has nothing to do with hypoxia, a condition in which your body is deprived of oxygen, which is why it doesn\u2019t make sense to give oxygen for these conditions,\u201d Turowski notes.\nWhy then do so many people report feeling better after going to oxygen bars? \u201cBlame the placebo effect,\u201d Dr. Edelman says. It may be all in your head.\nPotential Health Risks of Recreational Oxygen Use\nOxygen bars and the like may not pose major health threats for healthy people. \u201cIt might be better than going to a bar to drink,\u201d Edelman says. But there are some aspects of recreational oxygen use that could pose health risks.\nFirst, the cleanliness of breathing devices at oxygen bars needs to be considered. \u201cUnlike medical-grade oxygen therapy where we provide sterile tubing, I\u2019m not sure oxygen bars are subjected to any oversight, whether the tubing is exchanged between users, and how the non-medical grade oxygen concentrator is maintained or whether humidification is provided,\u201d Turowski says.\nWithout fresh tubing or devices to sterilize that tubing, mold and bacteria could grow, which could be troublesome for people with existing lung problems. In fact, if you have medical conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, or congenital heart or vascular disorders, it\u2019s best to avoid oxygen bars. This is especially true if you\u2019re using medical-grade oxygen.\n\u201cYou could increase the likelihood of developing an unintended but possible complication like infection or exacerbation due to circumstances related to cleanliness and lack of standardization of equipment,\u201d Turowski says.\nMany oxygen bars infuse the oxygen with scents that aren\u2019t designed to be in your lungs in high concentrations. Although the consequences of these scents aren\u2019t known, there could be potential ill effects on your lungs, especially for people, like those with asthma, who might react to strong smells, Turowski says.\nAlthough certainly trendy, oxygen bars and inhaled oxygen products may be little more than hot air for healthy people who aren\u2019t climbing Mount Everest, where supplemental oxygen is required.\nA better option? Take a walk through the woods and get a real sensory journey while inhaling Mother Nature\u2019s fresh \u2014 and free \u2014 oxygen.\nNEWSLETTERS\nSign up for our Heart Health Newsletter!\nEnter your email\nBy subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.", "docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_39_1165221603"}

JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images\nCancer is a disease that looms large. It is one of the leading causes of death and one in three of us will be diagnosed with it during our lifetimes. Unfortunately, the cancer rates are only rising. The National Institute of Cancer estimates that by 2030, its death toll will have increased by 60%. Some are looking to cannabis to cure this deadly disease. But is cannabis a cure \u2013 or is this just wishful thinking?\nCancer Patient Success Stories With Medical Pot\nAnecdotal accounts abound of patients curing their own cancer using high-potency edible cannabis extracts. Take Dennis Hill, a prostate cancer patient who decided to forgo chemotherapy and try cannabis instead. His story of complete recovery after six months of cannabis use is available online \u2013 along with his medical record and journal of his progress. Or Kelly Hauf \u2013 who decided to try cannabis oil in the months leading up to a scheduled surgery to remove a brain tumor. After eight months of treatment, there was nothing left of her tumor to remove. These stories are hard to ignore \u2013 but many doctors advise patients not to assume that cannabis was the cause of these incredible recoveries.\nDoctors Cautious About Weed for Cancer\nDr. Abrams, a leading oncologist at the UCSF Osher Center for Integrative Medicine says he has seen cannabis help many with the side effects of cancer but cautions against assuming cannabis is a cure. He says given his high proportion of cannabis using patients, \u2018if cannabis definitively cured cancer, I would have expected that I would have a lot more survivors.\u2019\nCannabis is well-established as a treatment for the side effects of cancer and chemotherapy, like nausea, vomiting, pain, anxiety, insomnia, and lack of appetite. But in a comprehensive review of the cannabis literature, researchers from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine found there to be insufficient evidence to say that cannabis can treat cancer directly. Without large-scale, placebo controlled clinical trials, doctors and researchers don\u2019t have the solid evidence they\u2019d need to recommend cannabis for cancer treatment.\nScience Shows Cannabis Has Anti-Cancer Properties\nStill other scientists are more hopeful about cannabis\u2019 potential efficacy, and point to laboratory and animal studies that show cannabinoids like CBD and THC kill cancer cells in laboratory conditions \u2014 without harming the healthy cells nearby. While clinical trials on human subjects is still a ways off \u2014 given cannabis\u2019 status as a controlled substance \u2013 the preclinical data gives reason to hope that patients stories of success aren\u2019t just flukes.\n\u201cThere is a large body of scientific data which indicates that cannabinoids specifically inhibit cancer cell growth and promote cancer cell death\u201d explains Dr. David Meiri, the lead researcher on an Israeli project studying 50 varieties of cannabis and its effects on 200 different cancer cells. Meiri and his team have successfully killed brain and breast cancer cells through exposure to cannabis and they are hopeful they can find more varieties of cancer cells that respond to this treatment.\nStill, experts caution against forgoing traditional treatment options. Dr. Meiri\u2019s research suggests that not all cancer cells respond to cannabinoids in the same way. Even if cannabis can help with some cancers, it might not work the same for all. Additional research, specifically placebo-controlled clinical trials, are needed to fully understand how to handle each type of cancer individually.\nWith a condition as deadly as cancer, it is crucial to know whether a high cannabinoid regimen would work for any particular case, before foregoing alternatives that might help. Still while clinical research on cannabis continues to stall, patients must decide whether to wait indefinitely or follow in the footsteps of patients before them \u2013 experimenting with cannabis on their own.\nSHARE\ntrending\n\u201cDazed and Confused\u201d\u2026 and Surprisingly Poignant: Iconic Movie Quotes About Cannabis\nMay 18, 2021 Elissa Esher\nOPINION: Cannabis legalization must include social equity\nMay 11, 2021 Leigh Vinocur\nEar Bud, Episode 3: The secret to better highs?

Legg, Ph.D., CRNP \u2014 Written by Rachel Nall, MSN, CRNA on March 13, 2020\nWhy this happens\nExamples\nSymptoms\nCan you recognize a false memory?\nTakeaway\nShare on Pinterest\nFilm producer Robert Evans famously said, \u201cThere are three sides to every story: your side, my side, and the truth.\u201d Evans had it right in some respects, as people can mistakenly create false or pseudomemories. This is the case for the Mandela effect.\nThe Mandela effect occurs when a large group of people believe an event occurred when it did not.\nThere are many examples of the Mandela effect in popular culture. This article will explore why and how these false memories occur.\nWhy this happens\nThe Mandela effect got its name when Fiona Broome, a self-identified \u201cparanormal consultant,\u201d detailed how she remembered former South African President Nelson Mandela dying in the 1980s in prison (although Mandela lived until 2013).\nBroome could describe remembering news coverage of his death and even a speech from his widow about his death. Yet none of it happened.\nIf Broome\u2019s thoughts occurred in isolation, that would be one factor. However, Broome found that other people thought the exact same as her.\nEven though the event never happened, she wasn\u2019t the only one who felt like it did. As a result, the Mandela effect concept was \u201cborn.\u201d\nCollective false memories\nAnother way to describe the Mandela effect is \u201ccollective false memories.\u201d A large group of people collectively always say a particular saying or memory a certain way when, in reality, the truth is different from the memory.\nConspiracy theorists believe the Mandela effect is an example of alternate universes present in society. However, doctors have a much different explanation of memory, and how some memories, although vivid, can be false.\nConfabulation\nSome doctors believe the Mandela effect is a form of confabulation.\nA common analogy for confabulation is \u201chonest lying .\u201d A person creates a false memory without intending to lie or deceive others. Instead, they\u2019re attempting to fill in gaps in their own memory.\nMany examples of the Mandela effect are close to the original or true memory. Some researchers believe that people \u2014 even a large group of people \u2014 use confabulation to \u201cremember\u201d what they feel is the most likely sequence of events.\nFalse memories\nOther aspects of memory may lead to the Mandela effect. This includes false memories, where your recall of an event isn\u2019t an accurate depiction.\nThis is often a struggle for eyewitnesses to a crime or important cultural event. Also, the abilities of people across the internet to alter images, logos, and sayings may affect your recall of the original item.\nExamples of the Mandela effect\nThere are many sites dedicated to people chronicling examples of the Mandela effect, including Reddit.\nOften, people are disturbed to find out how they, and a lot of other people, remember an event isn\u2019t exactly the way they remembered it. Here are some examples:\nThe Berenstein Bears vs. The Berenstain Bears\nMany people remember the \u201cBerenstein Bears\u201d as a lovable bear family. But this isn\u2019t actually their name. They\u2019re the \u201cBerenstain Bears.\u201d\nJif vs. Jiffy logo\nJif is a popular brand of peanut butter, but many people remember the brand\u2019s label a little differently \u2014 specifically as Jiffy.\nLooney Tunes vs. Looney Toons logo\nMany people think the logo for the Warner Brothers\u2019 cartoons was spelled \u201cLooney Toons.\u201d Actually, it\u2019s \u201cLooney Tunes.\u201d\n\u2018I am your father.\u2019\nMany people who quote this famous line in \u201cStar Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\u201d say, \u201cLuke, I am your father.\u201d However, Darth Vader actually says, \u201cI am your father.\u201d There is no \u201cLuke\u201d at all.\nThere are hundreds to thousands of examples of the Mandela effect across entertainment, logos, and even geography. Reading these examples can make you question your memory.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of the Mandela effect include:\nremembering something as slightly different in wording or appearance as it originally was\na large number of people recounting the same way of remembering\nOne way to think of the Mandela effect on your memory is to consider the way you recall information like the childhood game of telephone.\nDuring this game, an initial statement is spoken and whispered to one person, then the next and the next until the message is delivered to the final person.\nUsually, in telephone, the final message would be slightly different because people heard or remembered it slightly differently. This is true for your memory.\nYou may \u201cpull\u201d a memory from your brain, but time and infrequent recall can cause you to put the memory back together in a slightly different way.\nHow can you recognize a false memory?\nWe won\u2019t lie \u2014 it\u2019s really difficult to recognize a false memory. Usually the only way to know your memory is false or real is to corroborate your story with other people or research.\nIf you remember a saying a certain way, you can look it up from a reliable site or sites, or attempt to confirm it with others.\nOne of the problems with corroborating a story with others is that people tend to confirm what another person believes to be true.\nAsking a person, \u201cDidn\u2019t Nelson Mandela die in prison?\u201d or \u201cNelson Mandela died in prison, right?\u201d is a leading question that increases the likelihood a person will answer yes.\nA better question may be, \u201cHow did Nelson Mandela die?\u201d\nFortunately, when it comes to the Mandela effect, most false memories seem to be harmless. Replacing an \u201ca\u201d in Berenstein with an \u201ce\u201d usually only harms your pride in remembering small details.\nThe bottom line\nThe Mandela effect is an unusual phenomenon where a large group of people remember something differently than how it occurred.\nConspiracy theorists believe this is proof of an alternate universe, while many doctors use it as an illustration of how imperfect memory can be sometimes.\nLast medically reviewed on March 13, 2020", "docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_42_654618974"}

Using brains from animals killed for food, researchers have now restored some cellular functions in pig brains hours after death, potentially offering a new avenue for studying and treating brain diseases and disorders.\nBy Michael Greshko\nPublished April 17, 2019\n\u2022 15 min read\nShare\nTweet\nEmail\nScientists have restored cellular function in 32 pig brains that had been dead for hours, opening up a new avenue in treating brain disease\u2014and shaking our definition of brain death to its core. Announced on Wednesday in the journal Nature, researchers at the Yale University School of Medicine devised a system roughly analogous to a dialysis machine, called BrainEx, that restores circulation and oxygen flow to a dead brain.\nThe researchers did not kill any animals for the purposes of the experiment; they acquired pig heads from a food processing plant near New Haven, Connecticut, after the pigs had already been killed for their meat. And technically, the pig brains remained dead\u2014by design, the treated brains did not show any signs of the organized electrical neural activity required for awareness or consciousness.\n\u201cClinically defined, this is not a living brain,\u201d says study coauthor Nenad Sestan, a neuroscientist at the Yale University School of Medicine.\nThe new system instead kept the brains in far better shape than brains left to decompose on their own, restoring functions such as the ability to take in glucose and oxygen for up to six hours at a time. Researchers say that the technique could give a major boost to studies of human health by providing a rich testbed for studying brain disorders and diseases.\n3:43\nBrain 101\nThe brain constitutes only about 2 percent of the human body, yet it is responsible for all of the body's functions. Learn about the parts of the human brain, as well as its unique defenses, like the blood brain barrier.\n\u201cWe're really excited about this as a platform that could help us better understand how to treat people who have had heart attacks and have lost normal blood flow to the brain,\u201d adds Khara Ramos, director of the Neuroethics Program at the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. \u201cIt really enhances our ability to study cells as they exist in connection with each other, in that three-dimensional, large, complicated way.\u201d\nEven so, the finding opens up considerable ethical questions, a conversation that the researchers themselves welcome.\n\u201cThis is an extraordinary and very promising breakthrough for neuroscience. It immediately offers a much better model for studying the human brain, which is extraordinarily important, given the vast amount of human suffering from diseases of the mind [and] brain,\u201d says Nita Farahany, a bioethicist at the Duke University School of Law who wrote a commentary about the study for Nature.\n\u201cIt [also] challenges a lot of the fundamental assumptions that we had in neuroscience, like that once there is a loss of oxygen to the brain, it\u2019s an irreversible march toward organismal death,\u201d she adds. \u201cThat turns out not to be true\u2014and because that\u2019s not true, there's some pretty profound ethical and legal issues that are raised as a result.\u201d\nDefining death\nDeath is final, but the number of truly irreversible medical outcomes has shrunk over time. For millennia, people were considered dead when they stopped breathing and their hearts ceased to beat. But then modern medicine intervened. The invention of mechanical ventilators allowed failing bodies to be kept alive for longer, and decades of improvements to heart surgery and transplants mean that even a stopped heart might not necessarily be the end.\nBut the brain remains a finicky patient. Mammal brains such as ours are high-performance machines; they demand a constant stream of oxygen-rich blood to work to their fullest. If blood flow is cut off, we lose consciousness after just a few seconds. Within five minutes, the brain's stores of vital molecules such as glucose and ATP\u2014the body's universal currency for chemical energy\u2014run out.\nThe brain then enters a death spiral that, up to now, scientists considered irreversible: Nerve cells' delicate chemistries get thrown out of whack, a buildup of carbon dioxide makes the brain's blood more acidic, and leaks of a powerful neurotransmitter called glutamate quickly become toxic. Soon, enzymes that break down nerve tissue come online, and the brain's smaller structures and blood vessels rupture and break.\nThe more researchers understood this process, the more they incorporated it into the definition of death itself. In 1968, a committee of doctors assembled by Harvard University put forth a landmark definition of \u201cirreversible coma,\u201d what we now call \u201cbrain death\u201d: a total lack of responsiveness, the inability to breathe on one's own, a total lack of reflexes, and no signs of large-scale electrical activity in the brain. Now, the American Academy of Neurology maintains a checklist that clinicians use to judge brain death in patients.\nBut there have been hints of greater brain resilience. Some parts of brain cells, such as the mitochondria that process chemical energy, still work up to 10 hours after death. In cats and macaques, researchers have successfully made brains recover after a full hour cut off from blood by carefully restoring circulation. And in humans, some medical case studies point to a brain that can bounce back. In 2007, researchers reported that a woman suffering from acute hypothermia\u2014with a body temperature less than 65 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014 made a full neurological recovery.\nWorking, but not aware\nSestan and his colleagues, led by Zvonimir Vrselja and Stefano Daniele, resolved to test a complex mammal brain's ability to recover, so they devised what they call the BrainEx system.\nBrainEx consists of computer-controlled pumps and filters that send a nourishing solution through a dead, surgically exposed brain, with an ebb and flow that mimics the body's natural circulation. The proprietary solution is based on hemoglobin, the oxygen-ferrying protein in red blood cells, and is made to show up in ultrasound scans, so researchers can track its flow through the brain. Yale University has filed a patent for the system on behalf of its creators, but all of BrainEx's parts and procedures will be freely available to nonprofit and academic researchers.\nThe team took steps to ensure that the brains would not \u201cwake up\u201d in any way, let alone have awareness of the procedure's trauma. Though none of the brains in the experiment showed any sign of awareness, researchers stood at the ready to administer anesthesia and lower the brains' temperatures, just in case. What's more, the team added compounds in the solution to block neural activity, which served the extra goal of resting the brains' cells to give them better odds of healing.\n\u201cIt was in fact never a goal\u2014and even sort of the opposite of a goal\u2014of the research to have consciousness restored,\u201d says study coauthor Stephen Latham, director of the Yale Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics.\nFirst, the team checked to see whether BrainEx could restore circulation in the brain, even in its tiniest blood vessels. It does. Researchers also confirmed that the brain's blood vessels were in good enough shape that they could dilate in response to medications. Next, the researchers checked how well BrainEx preserved the overall structure of brain tissue. For the most part, BrainEx-treated brains looked comparable to brains in living animals or untreated brains an hour after death, and they were far more intact than untreated brains examined 10 hours after death.\nAt its most profound, the discussion around BrainEx shows how gains in knowledge and improvements in treatments have shifted the definition of death itself.\nBrain areas that are especially sensitive to oxygen loss, such as the hippocampus, also preserved well under BrainEx, as did the structures of individual neurons. And as they monitored the chemical differences in the solution flowing into and out of the brain, researchers found that the brain was making CO2 and using up glucose and oxygen\u2014signs of brain-wide metabolism restarting.\nThough researchers ensured that the experimental brains wouldn't have large-scale activity, they took small slices of brain tissue to test whether individual hippocampus neurons could still fire after treatment. They could.\n\u201c [That result was] the most surprising aspect to me as a working neuroscientist,\u201d says Allen Institute for Brain Science director Christof Koch, who wasn't involved with the study. \u201cThey were still capable of generating the spikes that are the universal idiom of fast electrical communication. It means that in principle, those neurons seem capable of neural activity.\u201d\nEthics of animal research\nThe BrainEx team is acutely aware of the ethical implications of its work, which is why they have consulted with leading neuroscientists and ethicists for years. The Neuroethics Working Group, a consortium convened by the U.S. National Institutes of Health's BRAIN Initiative, which funded the research, has been consulting with Sestan since 2016. The researchers also presented their work at a 2017 bioethics conference at Duke University and at a 2018 NIH workshop.\n\u201cCutting-edge science needs cutting-edge ethics,\u201d says Ramos, who serves as the Neuroethics Working Group's executive secretary. \u201cThere is an existing, robust framework of laws and policies that our funded researchers are expected to follow, but the development and application of new neuro-technologies may require us to examine those ethical standards, and for those standards to evolve.\u201d\nFor one, the technique opens up questions about the ethical use of non-human animals in experiments. As it stands, two sets of rules apply, one for live animals and another for dead animal tissues, since live animals can experience pain or distress. But which rules apply to BrainEx-treated brains from dead animals, especially if there is a chance they could be partially reawakened?\n\u201cThere's this kind of gaping hole in our protections of animal research subjects, [since] we now have this part-revived, slightly-alive category with the potential\u2014and, as of yet, not fully understood potential\u2014for recovery of function,\u201d says Farahany, who is also a member of the Neuroethics Working Group. \u201cIf you're seeking to revive pig brains, or other animal brains, does that mean that that becomes an animal research subject, rather than dead tissue?\u201d\n0:43\nWatch: Pig Lungs Filter Human Blood in a Lab\nHuman blood filters through pig lungs as they inhale and exhale in the lab of Lars Burdorf at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nExperts add that the ethical tradeoff here hinges on BrainEx's ability to further research into human disease\u2014or even save people from brain death.\n\u201cWe cannot willy-nilly impose, just for our curiosity, pain or agony on another creature unless there's a very good motive and the appropriate experiments,\u201d Koch says. \u201cCan this be used to rescue brains? Not just gee-whiz, let's see what happens here.\u201d\nExperts also say that BrainEx's ethical implications extend to the next logical question: Would it work on humans? On a technical level, Koch says that would not be a major leap, since both pigs and humans have large, complexly folded brains. But Koch and every other outside expert contacted by National Geographic urged caution in moving toward human trials.\nOn even broader horizons, future versions of BrainEx could complicate the process of organ donation by blurring the lines of brain death, note Case Western Reserve University bioethicists Stuart Youngner and Insoo Hyun in an accompanying commentary published in Nature. But Kevin Cmunt, CEO of Gift of Hope, one of the United States's largest organ donation networks, doesn't see BrainEx as a major disruption. He says that in many cases, organ donors who are declared brain-dead have suffered oxygen loss well beyond the study's time window, or substantial physical trauma. ( Other researchers are creating human-pig chimeras to advance organ transplant options .)\n\u201cI think that in the vast majority of brain-dead donors, this intervention would not be material,\u201d he says. \u201cThere may be a small subset of cases where [BrainEx] could impact the opportunity for donation, but I think it's relatively small.\u201d\nAnd if BrainEx does appear in clinics, Cmunt adds that it would be incorporated into the list of interventions before declaring someone brain-dead or deciding to end life support. The promise of brain recovery could even improve organ donations by giving medical professionals an even greater imperative to maintain circulation. Then, if the patient is declared brain-dead even after treatment with BrainEx, their organs could be more viable for donation than they would be otherwise.\n\u201cI don't necessarily see this as a conflict,\u201d Cmunt says. \u201cThese treatments would certainly be a part of care, just like hypothermia protocols are a part of care, and other things that we try to do to stop damage to organs and brains.\u201d\nOnly the beginning\nAt its most profound, the discussion around BrainEx shows how gains in knowledge and improvements in treatments have shifted the definition of death itself.\n\u201cImagine you're standing in the clinic, your dad is declared brain-dead, and you've just read this paper. You ask the surgeon, Well, what does brain-dead mean? He says it's irreversible loss of brain function, and you say, Well, wait a minute, there was this paper\u2014doesn\u2019t that mean that 'irreversible' today may not be 'irreversible' tomorrow?\u201d Koch says.\nBrainEx's space on the border of life and death echoes science fiction\u2014and at its most lurid, people may well think of Frankenstein and the prospect of resurrecting the dead. But Farahany cautions that we are still many miles away from that feat.\n\u201cIt is definitely has a good science-fiction element to it, and it is restoring cellular function where we previously thought impossible. But to have Frankenstein, you need some degree of consciousness, some 'there' there,\u201d she says. \u201cThey did not recover any form of consciousness in this study, and it is still unclear if we ever could. But we are one step closer to that possibility.\u201d\nEditor's Note: This article has been updated to clarify the affiliation of Khara Ramos.", "docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_47_1430382251"}

On Wednesday, loan operations staff at the New York bank wired $900 million, seemingly on behalf of Revlon Inc., to lenders of the troubled cosmetics giant controlled by billionaire Ron Perelman.\nIt was a mistake for the ages -- a \"clerical error,\" as Citigroup told lenders -- that's now plunged the bank into a battle between the Perelman empire and a corps of sharp-edged investment funds that have become its impatient creditors.\nOne financier involved likened the surprise payment to finding a fortune on the sidewalk. And, as of late Friday, several hedge funds who claim Revlon was in default on the loan were showing no signs that they'll be giving Citigroup its money back.\nThe wayward transfer of nearly a billion dollars appears to be one of the biggest screw-ups on Wall Street in ages, and it's set tongues wagging in financial markets. The question everyone is asking: how could this happen?\nA spokeswoman for Citi declined to comment. A representative for Revlon said in an emailed statement that Revlon itself didn't pay down the loan, or any portion of it.\n\"It's a billion-dollar clerical error,\" said Michael Stanton, a former restructuring and bankruptcy adviser. \"This is probably knocking around some very big rooms at Citibank.\"\nAcceleration Demand\nAt the center of the story is an increasingly ugly battle between Revlon and a group of lenders who sued the cosmetics company and demanded immediate repayment of a term loan that Revlon has coming due in 2023. Working with UMB Bank, the lenders are claiming that Revlon shifted some intellectual property rights that had been backing their loan into collateral for new debt.\nThe lenders, including Brigade Capital Management, Symphony Asset Management and HPS Investment Partners, are seeking a court order forcing the return of the collateral, which includes brand trademarks. Citi, the administrative agent on the loan, was also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, although it was in the process of resigning from the agent role.\nAround the same time the lawsuit was filed, the nearly $900 million -- an amount equal to the full principal value of the loan, plus accrued interest -- landed in the lenders' bank accounts, according to people familiar with the matter. Now, Brigade, Symphony and HPS are among that are refusing to hand the cash back, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing a private matter.\nCiti on Friday had yet to receive a majority of the funds back, though repayments continued to trickle in, the people said.\n\"This is what the investors asked for -- they wanted their loan to be paid off,\" said Bloomberg Intelligence senior distressed debt analyst Phil Brendel. \"Given their suit is against Citibank as well, it isn't clear why they would hand the money back.\"\nThe payment was a particularly welcome surprise considering that the loan trades for less than 30 cents on the dollar, signaling that investors have dim hopes of getting a full recovery under normal circumstances.\nCiti on Friday had yet to receive a majority of the funds back, though repayments continued to trickle in, the people said. The bank has launched an internal investigation into the matter, one of the people said.\nThe mistaken payment was first reported by LevFin Insights.\nRevlon said it would fight UMB's \"meritless\" lawsuit and that the bank doesn't have standing to sue because it's not the agent on the loan.\n\"This group of lenders has repeatedly resorted to baseless accusations in an attempt to enrich themselves and hurt the company by blocking Revlon from exercising its contractual rights to secure the financing necessary to execute our turnaround strategy and navigate the Covid-19 crisis,\" Revlon said in an earlier statement.\nPromoted\nListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\nRevlon, controlled by Perelman's MacAndrews & Forbes, has struggled to remain relevant and stem falling sales amid competition from Estee Lauder Cos. and a host of smaller companies using social media to lure customers.

You might recognize her as the pink-wigged teen who dances across Tik Tok compilation videos and YouTube thumbnails. Only recently has the internet star (This lady has 4.3 million Instagram followers and counting) become a household name, and for the most bizarre reason: She offered to sell her used bathwater for $30 a pop to her online followers.\nThe water sold out, and the bizarre story was picked up by major outlets, including The Guardian and The Cut. Who is this young woman who is obviously popular enough to pull off such a feat? According to Rolling Stone, the teen's Instagram account gained more than 3 million followers between November 2018 and July 2019, but before the unorthodox fame, the South African-born cosplay model was known as Belle Kirschner, a student at the top of her class who started hustling to make cash at age 13. And that was just the beginning. This is the untold truth of Belle Delphine.\nBelle Delphine's fans devised the bathwater business\nInstagram\nSelling \"gamer girl bathwater\" to \"thirsty gamer boys\" on the internet is bizarre, but Belle Delphine didn't hatch the plan entirely on her own. She was inspired by her followers. In an interview with Newsweek, the teenage Instagram star admitted she came up with the idea after her fans kept commenting on her photos, claiming they wanted to drink her bath water. \"I wondered if I actually were to take the joke seriously and sell my bathwater if there would be people out there that would buy it,\" she said. \"I sold around 500 units, far more than I expected, and I had to rebuy containers as I didn't have enough! And I was very surprised at the huge response I got, I didn't think my bathwater would get this much attention.\"\nFirst of all, that's a whole lot of baths, but Delphine did make a killing by investing little more some wrinkly fingers and toes. At $30 a pop, the self-proclaimed \"weird elf kitty girl\" made around $15,000, which certainly makes us think twice about flushing that liquid gold right down the drain.\nNo, it didn't give anyone herpes\nYouTube\nBelle Delphine's bath water undeniably flooded the internet. Her fans made reaction videos a cottage industry. Some YouTubers drank the water on camera; others used it to vape, and one guy made make mac and cheese and instant ramen with it. Who needs truffle oil when you've got what's essentially a gently steeped gamer girl tea? Okay, we just threw up in our mouths a little bit.\nDelphine's stunt went viral in more ways than one. Shortly after it made headlines, dirty rumors surfaced claiming the bath water gave more than 50 people herpes. According to Snopes, the whole STD story turned out to be a hoax launched by a fake Daily Mail Twitter account. The account used the Daily Mail logo as an avatar and dubbed itself \"Daily Mail US,\" but it's handle was @BlakeRises. In a since-deleted tweet (via Snopes ), the Twitter impersonator eventually came clean about the big fib. \"It seems the best way to grow on Twitter is to impersonate a company [the Daily Mail] and say things about a celebrity [Belle Delphine] that legally can be considered libel and I could potentially be sued for,\" the twitter culprit confessed. According to Snopes, Delphine also refuted the herpes claims.\nBelle Delphine was born in South Africa\nYouTube\nBelle Delphine, the online influencer who tacked googly eyes onto a dead octopus and called it her best friend, rarely dives into her origin story, but she did reveal a little about her background in an Instagram post in February 2019. She claimed she was born in South Africa with a dislocated hip that required extensive surgery. Luckily, the surgeries worked and she can now do things such as walk, pretzel herself into a mini-fridge, and shower herself in raw eggs .\nDelphine said she moved to the U.K. when she was 9 years old and revealed that it feels like she's \"lived two lives\" because she's grown up on two continents. In South Africa, she spent a lot of time outdoors enjoying the gorgeous mountains and beaches. In the U.K., she discovered the internet \u2014 and everyone knows how that went.\nBelle Delphine was a 14-year-old dropout\nInstagram\nBelle Delphine might be the \"greatest troll on the Internet,\" at least according to Rolling Stone, so it shouldn't be surprising that she'd need some mega-smarts to constantly one-up bored, lonely dudes online. Fortunately, Delphine was always at the top of her class in school, aside from English, where she claims she was put in a \"special\" group because of her poor spelling skills. Nonetheless, the Instagram model found herself having a difficult time during her early teen and pre-teen years. She kept switching schools, then eventually dropped out at age 14. By the time she was 15, she had moved out of her parents' house into a shared home, where she spent a year.\nDelphine has been a hustler from an early age. She claims to have worked since she was 13, holding down a number of odd jobs. According to Before They Were Famous, the star was a waitress and worked at a coffee shop. When she was 17, she spent six months babysitting. The teen eventually raised enough money to get a camper van and travel through France for a month. Now, the bath water mogul probably has enough cash to \u2014 in the very least \u2014 upgrade to a luxury bus.\nBelle Delphine followed the influencer formula\nYouTube\nBelle Delphine launched her career on the internet just like many a social media star. There was nothing vaguely scandalous about what she was doing when she posted her first Facebook photo in 2013. According to Before They Were Famous, the star followed with her first ever Instagram selfie in 2015, but she didn't start posting \"more intense\" (read: sexy) cosplay photos until two years later. In 2016, she launched her YouTube channel with a makeup tutorial \u2014 a go-to move for aspiring influencers \u2014 but at the time of this writing, she's only posted three videos on that channel, despite amassing nearly half a million subscribers.\nAround this time, Delphine also exploded on Tik Tok, which is what really made her internet-famous. Pretty much anyone who's ever used the app has seen her dancing around in her pink wig. For some mysterious reason, she eventually got banned from the platform, but not before she garnered millions of views across her unique posts and various compilation videos. According to Rolling Stone, she managed to monetize her fame when she launched a Patreon in 2018. At the time of this writing, she has more than 4,280 patrons who each pay between $1 and $2,500 per month for various prizes, such as access to her private Snapchat account, which she claims is her \"naughtiest\" social media platform.\nBelle Delphine angered the masses with a video prank\nYouTube\nBefore the bath water stunt, Belle Delphine managed to garner some notoriety when she trolled her fans with a fake account on a major adult video website. This girl apparently just loves messing with \"thirsty gamer guys.\" In 2019, the Instagram star took a minor pause from posting vaguely NSFW content to embark on the troll to end all trolls \u2014 one that would anger hoards of lonely men online. She put on her infamous pink wig, donned some pasties, and promised her 3.5 million Instagram followers that she'd make an account on a most-definitely NSFW video site if one of her photos was liked 1 million times. Her fans were motivated by this, liking the image nearly 2 million times, so Delphine kept her promise \u2014 sort of.\nAccording to Rolling Stone, she uploaded 12 videos to said website, but they were hardly raunchy. In the most PG of titles, \"PewDiePie goes all the way inside Belle Delphine,\" the star eats an actual picture of famed YouTuber PewDiePie. Other videos show the model making a literal cream pie and playing with two stuffed cats. Some fans found the prank funny, but a good number were infuriated. According to Newsweek, one disgruntled fan even claimed: \"You've got a bounty, wanted dead or alive. Be warned, don't mess with the gamers. You may of just started World War III.\" (C'mon man. Death threats aren't cool.)\nThis bath water mogul is worth half a million\nYouTube\nBelle Delphine has a unique brand that sells sex without really selling sex at all. According to Rolling Stone, she's caused \"a significant amount of controversy\" among those who work in the adult entertainment industry because she profits off their \"marketing tactics while simultaneously distancing herself from adult content creators.\" It's reportedly not rare for adult entertainers to sell bath water or bodily fluids, but Delphine is the one who's going viral for the stunt. She's also been accused of ripping off adult entertainers and appropriating Japanese culture.\nRegardless of what ideas Delphine has or has not co-opted, we can all agree that she's made a killing. At a minimum, she receives around $50,000 a year via her Patreon alone \u2014 and that's if everyone who subscribes pledges just $1. Considering Patreon users spend an average of $12 per month according to Vox, this bathing beauty could be making upwards of $500,000 per year and well on her way to joining some of the richest YouTube child stars on the planet. Dreshare places the Instagram model's estimated net worth at around half a million dollars.", "docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_48_730773621"}

Two others were also charged.\nThe hack embarrassed Twitter and called into question the security provided by a range of tech companies.\nCredit...\nJim Wilson/The New York Times\nBy Kate Conger and Nathaniel Popper\nPublished July 31, 2020 Updated Sept. 1, 2020\nOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 One by one, the celebrity Twitter accounts posted the same strange message: Send Bitcoin and they would send back double your money. Elon Musk. Bill Gates. Kanye West. Joseph R. Biden Jr. Former President Barack Obama. They, and dozens of others, were being hacked, and Twitter appeared powerless to stop it.\nWhile some initially thought the hack was the work of professionals, it turns out the \u201cmastermind\u201d of one of the most high-profile hacks in recent years was a 17-year-old recent high school graduate from Florida, the authorities said on Friday.\nGraham Ivan Clark was arrested in his Tampa apartment, where he lived by himself, early Friday, state officials said. He faces 30 felony charges in the hack, including fraud, and is being charged as an adult.\nTwo other people, Mason John Sheppard, 19, of the United Kingdom, and Nima Fazeli, 22, of Orlando, Fla., were accused of helping Mr. Clark during the takeover. Prosecutors said the two appeared to have aided the central figure in the attack, who went by the name Kirk. Documents released on Friday do not provide the real identity of Kirk, but they suggest that it was Mr. Clark.\nMr. Clark was skilled enough to go unnoticed inside Twitter\u2019s network, said Andrew Warren, the Florida state attorney handling the case.\n\u201cThis was not an ordinary 17-year-old,\u201d Mr. Warren said.\nMr. Clark convinced one of the company\u2019s employees that he was a co-worker in the technology department who needed the employee\u2019s credentials to access the customer service portal, a criminal affidavit from Florida said. By the time the hackers were done, they had broken into 130 accounts and raised significant new questions about Twitter\u2019s security.\nDespite the hackers\u2019 cleverness, their plan quickly fell apart, according to court documents. They left hints about their real identities and scrambled to hide the money they\u2019d made once the hack became public. Their mistakes allowed law enforcement to quickly track them down.\nLess than a week after the incident, federal agents, search warrant in hand, went to a home in Northern California, according to the documents. There, they interviewed another youngster who admitted participating in the scheme. The individual, who is not named in the documents because he or she is a minor, gave authorities information that helped them identify Mr. Sheppard and said that Mr. Sheppard had discussed turning himself in to law enforcement.\nBecause Mr. Clark is under 18, he was charged by the Florida state attorney in Tampa, rather than by federal authorities. His age also means that many details of his case are being kept under wraps.\nFederal authorities were already tracking Mr. Clark\u2019s online activity before the Twitter hack, according to legal documents. In April, the Secret Service seized over $700,000 worth of Bitcoin from him, but it was unclear why.\nThe documents released on Friday largely repeat what several hackers involved in the attack told The New York Times two weeks ago: The hack began early on July 15 as a quiet scheme to steal and sell unusual user names.\nBut as the day wore on, the attack, led by Kirk, took over dozens of accounts belonging to cryptocurrency companies and celebrities. Bitcoin flowed into the hackers\u2019 accounts. The scheme netted Bitcoin worth more than $180,000, according to a New York Times estimate.\nA special agent with an Internal Revenue Service investigative unit said in a court filing that Mr. Sheppard participated in the hack while using the screen name \u201cever so anxious.\u201d A person using that name told The Times a few days after the attack that he got involved because he wanted to acquire unique Twitter user names.\n\u201ci just kinda found it cool having a username that other people would want,\u201d \u201cever so anxious\u201d said in a chat with The Times. He ultimately brokered the sale of at least 10 addresses, such as @drug, @w and @L, according to the indictment against him.\nMr. Fazeli is also accused of serving as a middleman, helping to sell stolen Twitter accounts on the day of the attack under the user name \u201cRolex.\u201d But the indictment provides few details on Mr. Fazeli\u2019s work as a middleman.\nBy the time Twitter finally managed to stop the attack, the hackers had tweeted from 45 of the accounts they had broken into, gained access to the direct messages of 36 accounts, and downloaded full information from seven accounts, the company said.\nMr. Fazeli and Mr. Clark were arrested on Friday. Mr. Sheppard has not been arrested but is expected to be taken into custody, the F.B.I. said.\n\u201cWhile investigations into cyber breaches can sometimes take years, our investigators were able to bring these hackers into custody in a matter of weeks,\u201d said John Bennett, a special agent in charge with the F.B.I. The investigation is still underway, and it is possible there will be additional arrests, a bureau spokeswoman said.\nThe young men who participated in the breach come from a loose-knit community of hackers who focus on account takeovers, cybersecurity experts said. Using a practice known as SIM-swapping, they often target telecom companies to compromise victims\u2019 phone numbers and intercept login credentials.\nThe attackers targeted Twitter employees, stealing their account credentials in order to gain access to an internal system that allowed them to reset the passwords of most Twitter users. (Some users, like President Trump, have extra security on their accounts to prevent takeovers.)\n\u201cThese people come trained to be efficient and creative at their attack methods,\u201d said Allison Nixon, the chief research officer of the security firm Unit 221B. \u201cThey\u2019ve realized there\u2019s this world of soft targets.\u201d\nThese hackers often focus on financial fraud, but their ability to gain access to the accounts of political figures could attract new and dangerous customers, Ms. Nixon said.\n\u201cOne of the things that concerns me is that, as these actors continue to refine their techniques and learn, they\u2019re going to realize that there are other customers who will pay a lot more for things other than a single-character user name,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve even scratched the surface of how much damage they could cause.\u201d\nIn a statement, Twitter thanked law enforcement for its \u201cswift actions\u201d and said it would continue to cooperate with the investigation.\nThe relatively young age of the hackers did not come as a surprise to security professionals who monitor the SIM-swapper community. Many of the people drawn to it are teenagers who pursue unique user names because controlling them conveys a sense of importance and clout.\n\u201cThis activity is addictive in a way, it\u2019s a thrill,\u201d Ms. Nixon. \u201cBreaking into gigantic companies and stealing ridiculous amounts of money is a huge thrill for them.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story", "docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_48_1289995263"}

Under current Champions League rules, for instance, the top four Premier League teams qualify each year to enter the Champions League group stage.\nWith the Super League, the 15 founding members would be involved annually, with five teams able to qualify on an annual basis. The standards for qualifying have not yet been explained.\nSuper League teams\nArsenal\nChelsea\nLiverpool\nManchester City\nManchester United\nTottenham Hotspur\nAtletico Madrid\nBarcelona\nReal Madrid\nAC Milan\nInter Milan\nJuventus\nThere are six from England\u2019s Premier League: Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur. There are three from Spain\u2019s La Liga: Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid. And there are three from Italy: AC Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus.\nNotably, there are no teams from Germany\u2019s Bundesliga as yet identified, although Bayern Munich is the reigning Champions League winner. And there is no representative from France\u2019s Ligue 1, although Paris Saint-Germain is involved in the 2021 Champions League semifinals.\nThe identity of the other three founding members has either not been established, or it has yet to be revealed. Given how poorly the secret of the Super League\u2019s Sunday night announcement was kept, it seems likely that those spots are being held in case particular clubs change direction.\nMORE: UEFA, Premier League criticize plans for Super League\nWhy are there no teams from Germany in Super League?\nHans-Joachim Watzke is CEO of Borussia Dortmund, which qualified for Champions League in nine of the past 10 seasons. He quickly announced that the club had \u201crejected\u201d the Super League plan. He also said Dortmund and Bayern \u2014 Bundesliga winners in each of the past eight seasons and clear favorite to win a ninth straight \u2014 had \u201c100 percent compatible views\u201d on the subject.\nGiven the consequences of this decision, it felt a bit presumptuous to take his word for that. After all, we\u2019re talking about what is essentially a revolution in European soccer.\nBayern still has not issued a statement on the subject. Its Twitter account on Monday was focused entirely on the club\u2019s attempt to secure another Bundesliga title.\nBut its chairman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, reportedly will accept a position on the UEFA board made vacant when Juventus chair Andrea Agnelli resigned following the Super League announcement. That would appear to confirm Bayern\u2019s intent to remain committed to Champions League.\nWhy is the Super League happening?\nMoney would be the easiest answer. Guaranteed involvement in a lucrative competition that would, by definition, be competitively prestigious is an obvious lure for all involved \u2014 as well as that the 20 clubs would not have to share revenue with myriad teams involved in Champions League\u2019s qualifying rounds and UEFA itself.\nChampions League payouts total an estimated $2.4 billion annually. The Super League clubs expect they\u2019ll generate more. J.P. Morgan has agreed to underwrite an initial $4.2 billion, according to Al-Jazeera, with a possibility that outside investors will be offered the opportunity to participate.\nThe increased revenue would come at a time when soccer clubs have experienced significant revenue declines because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gates have been eliminated or limited throughout the 2020-21 domestic and Champions League seasons. Because of quarantine restrictions, some Champions League games have been played in neutral countries in empty stadiums.\nHow will the Super League work?\nThe 20 teams will be split into divisions of 10, with each team playing home and away against the nine opponents in its division. The top four teams in each division would advance to a playoff round of quarterfinals, semifinals and final.\nThat would mean a total of 21 Super League games for the winner and runner-up.\nTeams in the current Champions League arrangement play 10 games if they reach the final. Under the renovated Champions League plan announced Monday, that would expand to between 14 and 16, depending on how a team performs in group play.\nThe Super League plan likely would further impact domestic cup competitions, particularly one such as England\u2019s Carabao Cup, because of the physical demands on players.\nHow will this impact Champions League?\nAs it stands, particularly with the top German clubs committed to remaining in Champions League, the competition figures to continue, albeit in a compromised form.\nRemember, though, that even with nearly all the UCL\u2019s best performers over the past couple of decades coming almost exclusively from the breakaway clubs (and those who most obviously declined to join), the Champions League is a continent-wide competition that involves clubs from 54 nations, including Georgia, Montenegro and the Faroe Islands.\nAll of those national associations and the clubs they represent figure to be damaged by the separation.\nWhat could stop it from happening?\nIt's possible, though unlikely, that the clubs could listen to the ardent supporters already lining up against this abdication of tradition. There is a report that Chelsea fans will protest outside its home stadium, Stamford Bridge, on Tuesday. A group of Liverpool fans posted a black sign with white lettering on a gate at Anfield stating, \"SHAME ON YOU, R.I.P. LFC, 1892-2021.\"\nBut the club owners will depend on fans' love of their clubs and the sport to supersede such conserns and displays.\nThe only thing that could stop this is a legal defeat. UEFA is warning of legal action, and the founding owners of Super League are promising the same.\nHow could it impact the World Cup?\nUEFA president Alexander Ceferin declared on Monday, \u201cThe players that will play in the Super League will be banned from playing in the World Cup and Euros. They will not be allowed to play for their national teams.\u201d\nUEFA might be able to constrain its member nations from including Super League players on their national teams. That would mean England doing without such players as forwards Harry Kane and Marcus Rashford, midfielder Jordan Henderson and defenders John Stones and Harry Maguire.\nBut to keep, say, Christian Pulisic from playing for the United States in World Cup qualifying and, if successful, at Qatar 2022, FIFA would need to issue a similar mandate.\nWhat are proponents of Super League saying?\nThey are not easy to find.\nThe Super League\u2019s official announcement is about the best one can do.\n\u201cWe will help football at every level and take it to its rightful place in the world,\u201d Real Madrid president Florentino Perez said in the Super League statement. \u201cFootball is the only global sport in the world with more than four billion fans, and our responsibility as big clubs is to respond to their desires.\u201d\nManchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer has been installed as vice chairman of the Super League.\n\u201cBy brining together the world\u2019s greatest clubs and players to play each other throughout the season, the Super League will open a new chapter for European football, ensuring world-class competition and facilities, and increased financial support for the wider football pyramid,\" he said.\nRegarding the potential damage to other European teams, from the official release: \u201cThe new annual tournament will provide significantly greater economic growth and support for European football via long-term commitment to uncapped solidarity payments, which will grow in line with league revenues.\u201d\nWhat's wrong with the Super League?\nWe could fill the whole article with this.\nThey are outraged by the impact of such a competition on the \u201cpyramid\u201d philosophy that exists in European soccer: teams can play their way up through the pyramid through the system of promotion and relegation. As they see it, all league positions are earned by performance, and that ultimately includes the Champions League and the less glamorous Europa League.\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson: \u201cWe\u2019re going to look at everything that we can do with the football authorities to make sure this doesn\u2019t go ahead as it\u2019s currently being proposed. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good news for fans. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good news for football in this country.\u201d\nPortugal and Real Madrid legend Luis Figo: \u201cThis greedy and callous move would spell disaster for our grassroots, for women\u2019s football, and the wider football community only to serve self-interested owners, who stopped caring about their fans long ago, and complete disregard for sporting merit. Tragic.\u201d\nFormer Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson: \u201cA piece of nonsense \u2026 it has done the reputation of clubs no good and has, in fact, alienated a great many supporters. It sells them right down the river, and you can\u2019t disregard your fans and customers.\u201d\nGerman World Cup champion Mesut Ozil: \u201cKids grow up dreaming to win the World Cup and the Champions League, not any Super League. The enjoyment of big games is that they only happen once or twice a year, not every week. Really hard to understand for all football fans out there.\u201d", "docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_52_1666095905"}

Several powerful forces are behind the move to a cash-free world, including some governments and large financial services companies. 1 \ufeff 2 \ufeff\nHowever, no society has gone totally cash-free just yet. In addition to logistical challenges, several social issues need to be addressed before society can give up on cash entirely. The benefits and disadvantages below can give you an idea of the myriad of effects going cashless can have on money and banking as you know it.\nBenefits\nLower crime rates, because there's no tangible money to steal\nLess money laundering, because there's always a digital paper trail\nLess time and cost associated with handling, storing, and depositing paper money\nEasier currency exchange while traveling internationally\nDisadvantages\nExposes your personal information to a possible data breach\nIf hackers drain your bank account, or you experience technical issues, you'll have no alternative source of money.\nThose with no knowledge, bank accounts, or mobile phones will struggle to keep up with evolving cashless technology.\nSome may find it harder to control spending when they don't see physical cash leaving their hands\nBenefits of a Cashless Society\nThose with the technological ability to take advantage of a cashless society will likely find that it's more convenient. As long as you have your card or phone, you have instantaneous access to all your cash holdings. Convenience isn't the only benefit. Here are some other benefits.\nLower Crime Rates\nCarrying cash makes you an easy target for criminals. Once the money is taken from your wallet and put into a criminal's wallet, it'll be difficult to track that cash or prove that it's yours. One study by American and German researchers found that crime in Missouri dropped by 9.8% as the state replaced cash welfare benefits with Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards. 3 \ufeff\nAutomatic Paper Trails\nSimilarly, financial crime should also dry up in a cashless society. Illegal transactions, such as illegal gambling or drug operations, typically use cash so that there isn't a record of the transaction and the money is easier to launder. Money laundering becomes much harder if the source of funds is always clearly identifiable. It is harder to hide income and evade taxes when there\u2019s a record of every payment you receive.\nCash Management Costs Money\nGoing cashless isn't just convenient. It costs money to print bills and mint coins. Businesses need to store the money, get more when they run out, deposit cash when they have too much on hand, and in some cases, hire companies to transport cash safely. Banks hire large security teams to protect branches against physical banks' robberies. Spending time and resources moving money around and protecting large sums of cash could become a thing of the past in a cashless future.\nInternational Payments Become Much Easier\nWhen you travel, you may need to exchange your dollars for local currency. However, if you're traveling in a country that accepts cashless transactions, you don't need to worry about how much of the local currency you'll need to withdraw. Instead, your mobile device handles everything for you.\nDisadvantages of a Cash-Free World\nDepending on your perspective, going cashless might actually be more problematic than beneficial. Here are some of the major downsides associated with a cashless financial system.\nDigital Transactions Sacrifice Privacy\nElectronic payments aren't as private as cash payments. You might trust the organizations that handle your data, and you might have nothing to hide. However, the more information you have floating around online, the more likely it is to wind up in malicious hands. Cash allows you to spend money and receive funds anonymously .\nCashless Transactions Are Exposed to Hacking Risks\nHackers are the bank robbers and muggers of the electronic world. In a cashless society, you're more exposed to hackers. If you are targeted, and somebody drains your account, you may not have any alternative ways to spend money. Even if you\u2019re protected under federal law, it will still be inconvenient to restore your financial standing after a breach.\nTechnology Problems Could Impact Your Access to Funds\nGlitches, outages, and innocent mistakes can also cause problems, leaving you without the ability to buy things when you need to. Likewise, merchants have no way to accept payments when systems malfunction. Even something as simple as a dead phone battery could leave you \u201cpenniless,\u201d in a sense.\nEconomic Inequality Could Become Exacerbated\nUnless special outreach efforts are made, the poor and unbanked will likely have an even harder time in a cashless society. If smartphone purchases become the standard way to transact, for example, those who can't afford smartphones will be left behind. The UK is experimenting with contactless ways to donate to charities and homeless individuals, but these efforts may not be developed enough yet to substitute cash donations. 4\nPayment Providers Could Charge Fees\nIf society is forced to choose from just a few payment methods, or if one app becomes the standard payment app, the companies who develop these services might not offer them for free. Payment processors may cash in on the high volumes by imposing fees, which would eliminate the savings that should come from less cash handling.\nThe Temptation to Overspend May Increase\nWhen you spend with cash, you recognize the financial impact by physically taking the cash out of your pocket and giving it to someone else. With electronic payments, on the other hand, it\u2019s easy to swipe, tap, or click without noticing how much you spend. Consumers may have to rethink the ways they manage their spending.\nNegative Interest Rates Could Be Passed Onto Customers\nWhen all money is electronic, negative interest rates could have a more direct effect on consumers. Countries like Denmark, Japan, and Switzerland have already experimented with negative interest rates. 5 \ufeff\nDropping the interest rate is typically a move to stimulate an economy, but the result is that money loses purchasing power. 6 \ufeff\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, negative interest rates reduce bank profitability, and banks could be tempted to hike fees on customers to make up that deficit. In 2021, banks are limited in their ability to pass on those costs, because customers can simply withdraw their cash from the bank if they don't like the fees. In the future, if customers can't withdraw cash from the bank, they may have to accept any additional fees.\nWhat Does a Cashless Society Look Like?\nWithout cash, payments happen electronically. Instead of using paper and coins to exchange value, you authorize a transfer of funds from a bank account to another person or business. The logistics are still developing, but there are some hints as to how a cashless society might evolve.\nCredit and debit cards are among the most popular cash alternatives in use today, but cards alone might not be enough to support a 100% cashless society. Mobile devices could become a primary tool for payments instead.\nElectronic payment apps, like Zelle, PayPal, and Venmo, are helpful for person-to-person payments ( P2P payments ). In addition, bill-splitting apps allow friends to split their bills easily and in a fair manner. Fintech companies like Stripe, Adyen, and Fiserv support business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B), or what they now merge into account-to-account (A2A) online payments in a reliable and speedy fashion.\nMobile payment services and mobile wallets like Apple Pay provide secure, cash-free payments. Many nations that use cash sparingly have already seen mobile devices become common tools for payments.\nCryptocurrencies are also part of the discussion. They\u2019re already used for money transfers, and they introduce competition and innovation that may help keep costs low. However, there are risks and regulatory hurdles that make them impractical for most consumers, so they might not yet be ready for widespread use.\nExamples of Cashless Societies\nSeveral nations are already making moves to eliminate cash, with the push coming from both consumers and government bodies. Sweden and India are two notable examples, with two different outcomes.\nSweden\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to see signs that say, \u201cNo Cash Accepted\u201d in Swedish shops. According to the European Payments Council, cash transactions accounted for just 1% of Sweden's GDP in 2019, and cash withdrawals have been steadily declining by about 10% per year. 2 Consumers are mostly happy with this situation, but those who struggle to keep up with technological developments continue to rely on cash. Sweden is gearing up to become the first cashless nation in the world, with an economy 100 percent digital by 2023.\nIndia\nThe Indian government banned 500 and 1,000 rupee notes in November 2016, in an effort to catch criminals and those working in the informal economy. 1 The implementation was controversial, in part because roughly 99% of those banknotes were eventually deposited. 7 However, criminals weren't punished for hoarding untraceable cash, which had been the intent of the move. The Economic Times cited the Reserve Bank of India as it reported that electronic transactions has increased temporarily, but cash returned to pre-demonetization levels by the end of 2017. 8\nWhile these two examples had varying levels of success, both countries struggled to address how the marginalized would fare in a 100% cashless society.\nArticle Sources\nBritish Broadcasting Corporation. \" India Scraps 500 and 1,000 Rupee Bank Notes Overnight .\" Accessed June 10, 2020.\nEuropean Payments Council. \" Sweden: Cashless Society and Digital Transformation .\" Accessed June 10, 2020.\nIZA: Institute of Labor Economics. \" Less Cash, Less Crime: Evidence From the Electronic Benefit Transfer Program ,\" Page 2.

It is a society of people who believe, essentially, that the birds that exist and live in our world today are not really birds at all, but rather government surveillance drones. These people claim that their theory dates back all the way back to 1959.\nThis group, recently taking College of Charleston's campus by storm, preaches that birds all over the country are secretly just cameras controlled by our government used to watch our every move.\nSince \"Birds Aren't Real\" has become so prevalent in the CofC campus recently, I decided to sit down with its leader, its members (supposedly called disciples) and fellow kids around campus who have been affected by the movement to see just how serious and impactful this conspiracy has become.\nThe first mention incoming freshman seem to have had with \"Birds Aren't Real\" are the flyers and stickers posted all around campus. Some heard from word of mouth, but the majority of people just started seeing tons of signs posted all around their residence hall advertising: \"Birds Aren't Real\" with a picture of a bird and text beside it that reads: \" = Government Surveillance Drone.\"\nSo besides a national scale, what made this fad so popular among CofC freshmen? Well, after talking with people, I met with the suspected instigator of the posters and flyers we all see around campus.\nFor privacy's sake, I won't give you their name. But I will give you what they have to say about this movement and everything it entails.\nI met with the leader of this group in a dorm room, which was completely filled with \"Birds Aren't Real\" paraphernalia and also a few ruined posters which had hate plastered across them.\nSupposedly, he and his friends thought it was odd, yet humorous how a good amount of people not only opposed their movement but that they actively went out of their way to destroy their flyers.\nAnd ruined paper isn't the only hate they've received. On Second Sunday, when Charleston closes down a portion on King Street to host festivities, the leader of this group went out with a poster board that read \"Make Love, Not Birds\" across it. He said it was for the purpose of \"enlightening people\", and a fun, light-hearted way to get people interested in their cause. However, he received pushback as well, one woman going so far as to deter him and tell him he would be scaring the children.\nDespite the hate, he seemed very optimistic about it all, and he and his friends have enjoyed how their movement has evolved so far. The leader says he is open to creating a volunteer-based club, though he would not affiliate it with College of Charleston.\nHe says that he enjoys the independence of their group and would rather the attention focus more on the club itself, than the fact that it is affiliated with the college. His members seem to think the same thing, one even said they enjoy the work they're doing now, and they have more freedom because of the independence in being a non-college related club.\nThis member says that they push their agenda to buy passing out flyers, posting stickers around Charleston and wearing merchandise in support of the cause. The members also regulate the @birdsarentreal.charleston Instagram page, on which the leader says you can email or direct message him through if you are interested in helping out or have any questions.\nSo this group is actively involved in its community, but what do the people of CofC think about the movement? Some people are not too happy about the whole ordeal. The people actively involved in the \"Birds Aren't Real\" movement, have been posting signs outside people's dorm doors, which isn't exactly allowed in residence halls.\nThis action has received a complaint, but mostly from those who don't support or find humor, in the message these people are posting. One opposer says, \"I think it's a little stupid. I don't think you should say they're fake because that supports fake information.\"\nAnother commented,\"...it's kind of obnoxious, they sort of bully people? But \"bully\" is an extreme word... I just wish they didn't put that stuff on my door, I don't want that lol\". And this opinion was shared by a few people I've talked to, many saying that if the agenda wasn't pushed on them, then it wouldn't be a problem. Another issue was the dorm policy of flyers, which are not allowed in residence halls due to The College's sustainability guidelines.\nI spoke with Residence Life about the issue and they pointed out the complication, \"It wouldn't be a problem if he wasn't using so much paper. But using free prints at TD Arena and distributing them under peoples doors isn't sustainable and they aren't being recycled.\" With this in mind, is the movement really a positive thing? Or is it a mean-spirited joke cast around campus?\nLuckily for all our \"Birds Aren't Real\" advocates out there, the amount of support this group has gotten far exceeds those who aren't too fond of it. For the majority of the people I talked to, even beginning the conversation they were laughing, most of them telling me they own flyers ad have put them up in their rooms.\nSome supporters decorated their room with origami birds made out of the flyers, which alludes to the \"Birds Aren't Real\"'s national t-shirt design, featuring a paper origami bird on a blank background. One girl spoke to the positive impact this group has had, saying \"It's for fun and people are making a joke, I've seen people making connections and bonds in the Berry [dorm] community.\"\nOther students said they've created jokes with their friends about it, and find the whole thing very humorous, and a very good way for their class to bond together over something.\nOne of the members spoke to faculty about his \"Birds Aren't Real\" when they asked him about it, and it resulted in a long conversation about the history of it and how the freshman class has adopted it. The faculty member loved it so much they asked for merchandise and flyers of their own. And it didn't stop there!\nOther faculties have said they would gladly oversee a CofC club for this group, though the leader still seems adamant that they should remain independent of the college.\nAt the end of the day, the \"Birds Aren't Real\" situation that has rocked Charleston's campus is one so very unique, and one that has truly had an overall positive vibe with students.\nFor me, I think sustainability is important, but the message and humor behind the movement are so fun for me, and I think it's important for students to have an outlet like this that they can express themselves with.\nMaybe the people of \"Birds Aren't Real\" can work towards a more sustainable way of getting their message across, and then perhaps even more students will be able to get behind this satirical phenomenon that has rallied so many.\nAnd to end, I'll leave you with the motto of this legendary organization: \"Stay Woke, Cougs\"\nReport this Content\nThis article has not been reviewed by Odyssey HQ and solely reflects the ideas and opinions of the creator.\nSubscribe to our\nNewsletter\nFeatured\nWhile You Are Ringing In The Summer, Don't Forget To Remember The Importance Of What We Have Off For.\nHome of the free because of the brave.\nOlivia White\n28 May\nNational Writers Society\n1983\nOlivia White\n\"The American flag does not fly because the wind moves it.

I'm easily my own worst critic in almost everything that I do. I'm a raging perfectionist, and I have unrealistic expectations for myself at times. I can remember simple errors I made years ago, and I still hold on to them. The biggest thing I'm trying to work on is giving myself grace. I've realized that when I don't give myself grace, I miss out on being human. Even more so, I've realized that in order to give grace to others, I need to learn how to give grace to myself, too. So often, we let perfection dominate our lives without even realizing it. I've decided to change that in my own life, and I hope you'll consider doing that, too. Grace begins with a simple awareness of who we are and who we're becoming. As you read through these five affirmations and ways to give yourself grace, I hope you'll take them in. Read them. Write them down. Think about them. Most of all, I hope you'll use them to encourage yourself and realize that you are never alone and you always have the power to change your story.\nKeep Reading...\nShow less\nEntertainment\nBreaking Down The Beginning, Middle, And End of Netflix's Newest 'To All The Boys' Movie\nNoah Centineo and Lana Condor are back with the third and final installment of the \"To All The Boys I've Loved Before\" series\nAmanda Brennan\n14 February\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n972968\nNetflix\nWere all teenagers and twenty-somethings bingeing the latest \"To All The Boys: Always and Forever\" last night with all of their friends on their basement TV?

Epic effectively provoked Apple\u2019s removal of Fortnite earlier today when it implemented its own payment processing system into the iOS version of the battle royale hit, an apparent violation of Apple\u2019s App Store guidelines.\n\u201cEpic brings this suit to end Apple\u2019s unfair and anti-competitive actions that Apple undertakes to unlawfully maintain its monopoly in two distinct, multibillion dollar markets: (i) the iOS App Distribution Market, and (ii) the iOS In-App Payment Processing Market (each as defined below),\u201d the complaint reads.\nEpic Games has filed legal papers in response to Apple, read more here: https://t.co/c4sgvxQUvb\n\u2014 Fortnite (@FortniteGame) August 13, 2020\n\u201cEpic is not seeking monetary compensation from this Court for the injuries it has suffered.

Instead, Epic is seeking injunctive relief to allow fair competition in these two key markets that directly affect hundreds of millions of consumers and tens of thousands, if not more, of third-party app developers.\u201d\nHere are Epic\u2019s primary claims in support of the argument Apple has violated US antitrust law:\nApple unlawfully maintains its monopoly power in the iOS App Distribution Market through the anti-competitive acts described herein, including by imposing technical and contractual restrictions on iOS, which prevents the distribution of iOS apps through means other than the App Store and prevents developers from distributing competing app stores to iOS users.\nApple unlawfully maintains its monopoly power in the iOS App Distribution Market through its unlawful denial to Epic and other app distributors of an essential facility\u2014access to iOS\u2014which prevents them from competing in the iOS App Distribution Market.\nTo reach iOS users, Apple forces developers to agree to Apple\u2019s unlawful terms contained in its Developer Agreement and to comply with Apple\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines, including the requirement iOS developers distribute their apps through the App Store. These contractual provision unlawfully foreclose the iOS App Distribution Market to competitors and maintain Apple\u2019s monopoly.\nApple has unlawfully maintained its monopoly in these markets through the anti-competitive acts alleged herein, including by forcing, through its contractual terms and unlawful policies, iOS app developers that sell in-app content to exclusively use Apple\u2019s In-App Purchase, and preventing and discouraging app developers from developing or integrating alternative payment processing solutions.\nTo reach iOS app users, Apple forces developers to agree to Apple\u2019s unlawful terms contained in its Developer Agreement, including that they use Apple\u2019s InApp Purchase for in-app purchases of in-app content to the exclusion of any alternative solution or third-party payment processor. Further, Section 3.1.3 of Apple\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines unlawfully prohibits developers from \u201cdirectly or indirectly target [ing] iOS users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase\u201d.\nApple is able to unlawfully condition access to the App Store on the developer\u2019s use of a second product\u2014In-App Purchase\u2014for in-app sales of in-app content. Through its Developer Agreement and unlawful policies, Apple expressly conditions the use of its App Store on the use of its In-App Purchase to the exclusion of alternative solutions in a per se unlawful tying arrangement.\nEpic is alleging Apple has a monopoly in the form of the iPhone, the iOS ecosystem, and the App Store that binds them together, and that Apple places unreasonable restrictions on the distribution of iOS apps \u2014 again, the only way to get software onto the iPhone (or iPad). The complaint is also alleging Apple places unreasonable restrictions on payment processing within iOS apps.\nEpic doesn\u2019t take issue with the fact that Apple requires developers to use the App Store. Rather, the game studio thinks it\u2019s unfair Apple requires you to use its payment methods, which thereby gives Apple 30 percent of all in-app revenue on the digital goods that make up the entirety of Fortnite \u2019s business model.\nEpic is trying to break up what it sees as Apple\u2019s monopoly on iOS\n\u201cApple is able to unlawfully condition access to the App Store on the developer\u2019s use of a second product\u2014In-App Purchase\u2014for in-app sales of in-app content,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cThrough its Developer Agreement and unlawful policies, Apple expressly conditions the use of its App Store on the use of its In-App Purchase to the exclusion of alternative solutions in a per se unlawful tying arrangement.\u201d\nEpic in its complaint leans heavily on the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, a monumental piece of antitrust legislation in the US used to break up monopolies during the turn of the 20th century. It remains the pillar of US antitrust law, and Epic claims Apple has violated six separate accounts of the Sherman Antitrust Act: an \u201cunlawful monopoly\u201d in the form of the App Store; \u201cdenial of essential facility\u201d in iOS app distribution; \u201cunreasonable restraints of trade\u201d in iOS app distribution; and then similar counts for in-app payment processing on iOS.\nThe final count referencing the Sherman Act is over Apple \u201ctying the App Store in the iOS App Distribution Market to In-App Purchase in the iOS In-App Payment Processing Market\u201d \u2014 effectively creating what Epic sees as a monopoly harming competition and causing harm to consumers through inflated pricing. (The complaint also accuses Apple of three counts of violating the California Cartwright Act, a state antitrust law prohibiting price-fixing and trade restraint agreements, and one count of violating California Unfair Competition Law.) Epic is able to make the pricing argument because it specifically lowered prices on its in-game Fortnite currency when it implemented its own payment processing system, saying it was passing the savings onto consumers in what is now a clear ploy to paint Apple\u2019s decision as anti-consumer.\n\u201cIn other words, app developers are coerced into using In-App Purchase by virtue of wanting to use the App Store. Apple\u2019s unlawful tying arrangement thus ties two separate products that are in separate markets and coerces Epic and other developers to rely on both of Apple\u2019s products,\u201d the complaint explains. \u201cEpic has been harmed by Apple\u2019s anti-competitive conduct in a manner that the antitrust laws were intended to prevent. Epic has suffered and continues to suffer harm and irreparable injury, and such harm and injury will not abate until an injunction ending Apple\u2019s anti-competitive conduct issues.\u201d\nScribd\nscribd.scribd.scribd.scribd.scribd.scribd.scribd.scribd.scribd.scribd.scribd.scribd.scribd.\nComplaint for Injunctive Relief\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Paul J.

Plaintiff Epic Games, Inc. (\n\u201c\nEpic\n\u201d\n), by its undersigned counsel, alleges, with knowledge with respect to its own acts and on information and belief as to other matters, as follows:\nNATURE OF THE ACTION\n1.\nIn 1984, the fledgling Apple computer company released the Macintosh\n\u2014\nthe first mass-m\narket, consumer-friendly home computer. The product\nlaunch was announced with a breathtaking advertisement evoking George Orwell\u2019s\n1984\nthat cast Apple as a beneficial, revolutionary force breaking IBM\n\u2019s\nmonopoly over the computing\ntechnology market. Apple\n\u2019\ns founder Steve Jobs introduced the first showing of the 1984 advertisement by explaining,\n\u201c\nit appears IBM wants it all. Apple is perceived to be the only hope to offer IBM a run fo\nr its money . . . . Will Big Blue dominate the\nentire computer industry? The entire information age? Was George Orwell right about\n1984?\u201d\n2.\nFast forward to 2020, and Apple has become what it once railed against: the behemoth see\nking to control markets, block competition, and stifle\ninnovation. Apple is bigger, more powe\nrful, more entrenched, and more pernicious than\nthe monopolists of yesteryear\n. At a market cap\nof nearly $2 trillion, Apple\u2019s size and\nreach far exceeds that of any technology monopolist in history. 3.\nThis case concerns Apple\u2019s use of a series of\nanti-competitive restraints and monopolistic practices in markets for (i) the distribution of software\napplications (\u201capps\u201d) to users of mobile computing devices like smartphones and tablets,\nand (ii) the processing of\nconsumers\u2019 payments\nfor digital content used within iOS mobile apps\n(\u201cin\n-app c\nontent\u201d)\n. Apple impose\ns unreasonable and unlawful restraints to\ncompletely monopolize both markets and prevent software developers from reaching the over one billion users of its mobile devices (\ne.g.\n, iPhone and iPad) unless they go through a single store controlled by Apple, the App Store, where Apple exacts an oppressive 30% tax on the sale of every app. Apple also requires softwa\nre developers who wish to sell\nof 65\nView on Scribd\nIn This Stream\nEpic Games v.

Zelman, MPH, RD, LD on June 19, 2019\nArticles On Benefits of Fruit\nBenefits of Pineapple\nBenefits of Oranges\nCranberry Benefits\nJackfruit Nutrition\nDragon Fruit Benefits\nIs Frozen Yogurt Healthy?\nThe largest tree fruit in the world, jackfruit -- sometimes called \"jak fruit\" or \"jak\" -- can be up to 3 feet long and 20 inches wide. Just one fruit can weigh as much as 110 pounds. But you're not alone if you haven't heard of it.\nWhile jackfruit first appeared in the rain forests of India, farmers now grow it in many parts of the world, including Thailand, Australia, Africa, Brazil, and the Philippines. Only in recent years has jackfruit started to become well known in the U.S.\nThe rind of a jackfruit is green or yellow and spikey. Although it gives off a smell of rotting onions when it's ripe and ready to eat, the pulp inside smells and tastes far better: like a cross between pineapple and bananas. You can eat the seeds, too. And a jackfruit has plenty of them -- up to 500. Each can reach an inch and a half in length.\nThere are two main types of jackfruit. One is small and mushy. It tastes sweet, but it's slimy. The other type of jackfruit has crisp, crunchy flesh that's not as sweet.\nNutrients per Serving\nOne cup of sliced raw jackfruit has:\nCalories: 157\nFat: 2 grams\nCarbs: 38 grams\nProtein: 3 grams\nCalcium: 40 milligrams\nVitamins\nJackfruit may be higher in some vitamins and minerals than apples, apricots, bananas, and avocados. For example, it's rich in vitamin C and one of the few fruits that's high in B vitamins.\nJackfruit also contains folate, niacin, riboflavin, potassium, and magnesium.\nAntioxidants\nCarotenoids, the pigments that give jackfruit its yellow color, are high in vitamin A. Like all antioxidants, carotenoids protect cells from damage and help your body work right. They may help prevent diseases like cancer and heart disease, as well as eye problems like cataracts and macular degeneration.\nAs a jackfruit ripens, its carotenoid levels may go up.\nJackfruit also contains many other antioxidants that can help delay or prevent cell damage in your body. While the inside flesh is high in these disease-fighting compounds, the seeds may contain even more.\nHealth Benefits\nThe nutrients in jackfruit may help lower your risk for some health issues, including:\nContinued\nConstipation. Jackfruit is a good source of fiber, so it could help you feel fuller for longer and help keep your bowel movements regular.\nUlcers. The natural chemicals in jackfruit may help prevent these sores from forming inside your stomach.\nDiabetes. Your body digests and absorbs jackfruit more slowly than some other foods. That means your blood sugar won't rise as quickly as it might when you eat other fruits. One study found that jackfruit extract made it easier for people with diabetes to control their blood sugar.\nHigh blood pressure. The potassium in this tropical fruit could help lower your blood pressure, which can help stave off heart disease, stroke, and bone loss.\nSkin problems. The high amounts of vitamin C in jackfruit may help protect your skin from sun damage. You need plenty of that nutrient to keep your skin firm and strong.\nCancer. Phytonutrients, like those found in jackfruit, are natural compounds that might have cancer-fighting benefits, such as preventing cancer cells from forming in your body.\nRisks and Warnings\nWhile a jackfruit allergy is rare, you're at higher risk if you have a birch pollen allergy. This means that you have an itchy mouth or swollen lips when you eat other foods in this group such as apples, almonds, carrots, celery, cherries, and hazelnuts.\nHow to Prepare It\nJackfruit isn't easy to peel because of its sticky sap. To keep it from gumming up your knife and hands, rub them with cooking oil before you slice open your fruit. Once you do, it will take time to separate the fleshy bulbs you can eat from tough strips of membrane, which you can't. You'll then have to remove the seeds from each bulb.\nYou may prefer to eat jackfruit before it's fully ripe and the rind starts to smell like spoiled onions. If you cut it into chunks and boil them in salted water until they're tender, you can easily slice the meaty flesh from the rind. You can roast or boil the seeds like chestnuts.\nContinued\nIf you don't want to prepare your own jackfruit, look for canned or ready-to-eat jackfruit at the store. You can find it seasoned with a savory BBQ or teriyaki sauce. Some people use these as a meat substitute. You can also get it preserved in a sweet, heavy syrup like other canned fruits.\nHere's a recipe for jackfruit barbecue sandwiches.\nHow to Store\nOnce a jackfruit's ripe, it will turn brown and go bad quickly. To keep yours fresh, store it in the refrigerator. When kept cool and dry, a ripe jackfruit can last up to 6 weeks.\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Pinterest Email Print\nPagination\n1\n2\n3\nView All\nNext In Benefits of Fruit\nDragon Fruit Benefits", "docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_57_933363597"}

EXTRATERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY, the sign reads, in a retro-futuristic font suggestive of a space computer. This road was so named\u2014around the time Independence Day came out\u2014because it\u2019s the stretch of asphalt closest to Area 51. Many a curious visitor have traveled its miles, watching for jet tests and drone forays, hoping to see something they might later boast was a UFO. For decades, some have thought the secretive base holds not just jets within its boundaries but also maybe aliens and their technology. This, of course, is conspiracy theory, based on not much but strange aerodynamic sightings and the word of a man named Bob Lazar. But the region kind of embraces its notoriety with a wink-wink and a nudge-nudge.\nThis week, though, the sign disappeared, removed in advance of the Storm Area 51 events taking place in the towns of Rachel and Hiko, Nevada. Officials were afraid that too many people would stop to pose for selfies, snarling the intersection. If the festivities so far, including Friday\u2019s early-morning \u201cattempt\u201d to \u201cbreach\u201d the base, are any indication, that is exactly the kind of trouble officials should have been worried about.\nThe joke Facebook event that started it all\u2014by suggesting people storm the gates of Area 51\u2014purported to be about uncovering government secrets. In reality it was about launching a meme and rocketing its creator to fame. It worked.\nAt the \u201craid,\u201d there was no storming, there were no aliens, and there were no steel-eyed demands to expose government secrets. There wasn\u2019t even really any serious UFO-truthing. There were just a bunch of kids in bright clothes, pointing cameras at each other, shouting meme text in ragged unison.\nWhen I drove down Extraterrestrial Highway on Wednesday evening, around half of the cars I passed were law enforcement. Their white sides whooshed by, their presence anomalous in this valley where almost no one lives.\nPhotograph: Sarah Scoles\nWith so little human-friendly infrastructure, and a lot of secrets to guard, the region had many reasons to beef up security. Curiously, though, so far there\u2019s no sign of Area 51\u2019s actual security\u2014which know-it-alls call Camo Dudes, the contract intimidators who drive unmarked Ford Raptors, cruise the dirt roads between the ET highway and the base\u2019s perimeter, follow you, visit your campsite after dark, and sit on a hill above the front gate.\nThey don\u2019t speak to or interact with you until you break the rules; in fact, they often cover their faces as they pass oncoming cars. Their function, for the most part, seems to be to act so scary that you don\u2019t consider breaking the rules. When I visited last fall to do some reporting for a UFO culture book, the tactics worked.\nThe police here for Storm Area 51, though, were friendly\u2014jovial even. They encouraged people to go up to the gates\u2014perhaps in a \u201cnothing to see here, ma\u2019am\u201d kind of way\u2014and seemed mostly curious about what would happen. Plus, this early in the week, they probably outnumbered the visitors. A meaningless digital RSVP, it turns out, isn\u2019t just a problem for your dinner party. It\u2019s a problem for secret-base raids, too.\nOn Thursday morning, a few people meandered around the Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn, the only business in Rachel, Nevada\u2014not just an inn but a bar, restaurant, and alien-themed souvenir shop\u2014the base for an event formerly known as Alienstock and now, after befalling some misfortune, called A\u2019le\u2019Inn Stock. With not many people onsite, I headed to Area 51\u2019s back gate instead, a 20-ish-minute drive from Rachel, in search of the crowd.\nDust rolls out from behind my car like a wave rip-curling. It\u2019s so dry out here that any guards could see cars coming for miles and miles before they arrived, evidence of their progress showing up like tiny, turbulent tornadoes. And indeed, the officer is ready for me when I arrive. He was called in from Lake Tahoe, he says, greeting me and a man from Ohio, who pulls up with a \u201cLET\u2019S SEE THEM ALIENS\u201d sign. He asks if I would take his picture. \u201cPHOTOGRAPHY OF THIS AREA IS PROHIBITED\u201d blares a red sign right behind him.\n\u201cCan I take a picture?\u201d I ask the officer.\n\u201cSure, go ahead,\u201d he says.\nLater in the day, I go to the other gate, where there\u2019s now a roadblock maybe a quarter-mile before the gate itself. Lincoln County police mill around, thumbs in belt loops and vest hems. The car can\u2019t go any farther, they say, but I\u2019m welcome to walk right up to the gate, with its cyclops cameras and razor wire. As I press on, the officer begins to walk and chat with me, and another officer follows behind us. It\u2019s a low-key version of escorting, one that makes it seem like they just enjoy my company, keeping the mood light. They\u2019re not going to stop anybody from storming the gate, they say. That\u2019s for the people on the inside.\nLEARN MORE\nThe WIRED Guide to Aliens\nBy Thursday evening, the crowds have begun to arrive, though not in droves. Yes, the A\u2019le\u2019Inn has rows of RVs parked in dusty squares. Yes, camps constellate the Bureau of Land Management acres throughout the valley, cases of Bud Light\u2019s special-edition green-man cans stashed in coolers and camper refrigerators and Camry trunks. Pulling up, I see people in true tin-foil hats, a guy mooning a camera with his alien boxers, and two young women in skin-sucking green suits. But up by the stage, where a band begins to play before the scheduled time (a miracle), the number of people counts in the dozens. Behind them sprawls an enormous dust parking lot, empty except for some twentysomethings practicing \u201cNaruto running\u201d beneath the floodlights, off-leash dogs uneasy with the bass levels, and people coming and going from the PortaPotties that probably outnumber the permanent residents of Rachel.\nPhotograph: Sarah Scoles\nI listen for an hour or so before heading back to my off-site camp to set an alarm for 1:30 am\u2014so I can see if anyone will, in fact, try to storm Area 51. When I get to my spot, a few miles away from town, the rumbling of military jets throttles the sky. I look ahead of the sound, where the fast-traveling craft would be. And there I see two triangular-looking somethings, flying close together and high up. I wave.\nThis, of course, is what visits to Area 51 are traditionally about. It is the isolation, the quiet, and the darkness that brought the military here in the first place. It is the lack of everything that makes it an appealing secret spot. It is the experience of that environment that feels meaningful and transgressive, historically.\nIt\u2019s different now. To visit when speakers drown out aerospace-y sounds, when stage lights blind you to the aircraft that might be hovering above, when there are so many eyes that the Air Force would be crazy to test anything actually advanced\u2014it kind of makes a trip to Area 51 not very much like a trip to Area 51.\nWhen my alarm goes off in the middle of the night, I can see headlights on Back Gate Road. Hovering low over the higher ground in the distance, they look vaguely UFO-like. Still, when I approach the gate\u2014where there\u2019s now a roadblock\u2014the number of cars parked there is underwhelming. Dudes in a giant Dodge Ram truck are playing extremely loud electronica that seems to be the same 30-second loop over and over.\n\u201cIf BLM comes up here they\u2019re going to be extremely upset,\u201d an officer says to them through a loudspeaker.
